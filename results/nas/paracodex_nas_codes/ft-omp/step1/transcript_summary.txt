Changes in `data/src/ft-omp/ft.c`:
- Added persistent device allocations for all working/scratch arrays via `omp_target_alloc`, freeing with `omp_target_free`.
- Kept RNG/index map generation on host for fidelity, then pushed `twiddle` and `u1_real/u1_imag` to device with `omp_target_memcpy`.
- Offloaded all heavy kernels (FFT init, forward/inverse FFT stages, evolve, checksum) with `target teams loop` and `is_device_ptr`, keeping stage loops serial per FFT rules.
- Added device-side reduction for checksum to avoid bulk copies; allocations/teardown wired through main flow.

Data plan recorded in `data/src/ft-omp/data_plan.md` reflecting host-setup/device-run strategy and transfer volumes.

Tested:
- `make clean`
- `timeout 300 env OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY make CC=nvc++ CLASS=A run > gpu_output.txt 2>&1`
  - Verification SUCCESSFUL.

Notes: compile emits benign string-literal/unused-var warnings. If you want Class B/C runs or profiling next, rerun with the same `OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY` setting after a clean.
