Copied `golden_labels/src/ft-serial/ft.c` into `data/src/ft-omp/` and authored loop analysis in `data/src/ft-omp/analysis.md` covering the main timed iteration, FFT butterfly stages, evolve kernel, setup loops, and RNG-related initialization with classifications/types/priorities. No source edits were made. 

Next steps: 1) Review the analysis.md to confirm priority assumptions; 2) If proceeding to offload, target the cffts*_neg stage loops first (Type C1) and evolve (Type A) for GPU parallelization.
