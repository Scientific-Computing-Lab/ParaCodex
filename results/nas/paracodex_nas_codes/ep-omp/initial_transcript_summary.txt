Copied the serial `ep.c` into `data/src/ep-omp/` and documented every loop in the timed region so you can prioritize parallelization efforts with the loop types/iterations already classified.

- Source drop: `data/src/ep-omp/ep.c:1` now holds an exact copy of the golden serial EP kernel for the offload workspace.
- Analysis: `data/src/ep-omp/analysis.md:1` records the loop-nesting hierarchy, per-loop priority/type, issues (recurrence, histogram, reductions), and data sketches required by the next-phase translation.
- Testing: not run (analysis-only change).

Next steps: 
1. Use the analysis to focus parallelization on `sample_loop`/`rand_fill`/`gauss_bin` (outer Type A with inner RNG Type E/D) and to plan where reductions/columned histograms need care.
2. Once you start modifying the kernel, rerun the EP benchmark to verify the RNG/scalar reductions still match the reference.
