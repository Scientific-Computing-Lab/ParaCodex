**Performance**
- Inlined the device RNG helper and marked the per-iteration invariants as `const`, then replaced the expensive `fabs/MAX` combo with manual branchless absolute math so the inner histogram loop stays register-bound; these changes keep the hot `target teams loop` (the RNG pair generation + histogram reduction) leaner without touching the existing data-mapping strategy (`ep.c:41-205`).
- `optimization_plan.md` now captures the fresh baseline (0.4590s), the micro-opt direction, and the final summary (0.3790s, 1.21× speedup) along with the applied micro-opts checklist and key insights to justify the tweaks (`optimization_plan.md:1-90`).
- Tests: `make clean` followed by `timeout 300 env OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY make CC=nvc++ CLASS=S run` (CPU Time = 0.3790s and the standard verification output still reports SUCCESSFUL; see `current_output.txt:92`).

Next steps: rerun the CUDA-aware profiler (nsys) against this new build to rebaseline kernel times and, if more gain is desired, explore device-side batching/fusion that can amortize the RNG loop rather than the micro-ops already applied.
