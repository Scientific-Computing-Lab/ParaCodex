Applied OpenMP GPU offload across the FT kernel with managed memory and team-based loops. Key updates:
- Added a device-visible `device_exp` helper and offloaded all heavy loops (initialization, evolution, 1D FFT stages, checksum) via `target teams loop`, relying on managed memory instead of explicit mapping (`data/src/ft-omp/ft.c`).
- Simplified data movement by removing the target data/update scaffolding; GPU accesses use managed allocations driven by OpenMP targets.
- Added a convenience `Makefile.nvc` wrapper to drive builds with the NVIDIA compiler (`data/src/ft-omp/Makefile.nvc`).

Build & run (cleaned first):
- `make -f Makefile.nvc clean`
- `make -f Makefile.nvc CC=nvc++ CLASS=B CFLAGS='-O3 -mp=gpu -gpu=ccall,mem:managed -Minfo=accel' CLINKFLAGS='-O3 -mp=gpu -gpu=ccall,mem:managed -Minfo=accel'`
- `./ft.B.x` → verification successful (Class B).

Notes: nvc++ emits benign warnings about string literal conversions and unused locals; no runtime issues observed. If you prefer, the `-gpu=ccall,mem:managed` flag can be adjusted to a specific SM (e.g., `-gpu=cc90,mem:managed`).
