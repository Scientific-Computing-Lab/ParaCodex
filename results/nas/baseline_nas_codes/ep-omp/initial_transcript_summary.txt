**EP GPU Offload**
- `ep.c` now marks the RNG constants/`randlc_ep` helper with `#pragma omp declare target` and copies their values to the device before the bulk chart—the GPU kernel now lives inside `data/src/ep-omp/ep.c:150` with a `target teams loop` over blocks, per-team reductions, and device-side `randlc_ep` use, so `xx` has been removed and new `qq` handling/reductions happen entirely on the GPU while results accumulate back on the host.
- Tested with `make CC=nvc++ CLASS=B` (warnings about `gate_ep_sums` and legacy string literals are pre-existing) and the resulting `./ep.B.x` run succeeded with verified output for Class B.

Next step: rebuild/test `CLASS=A` with the same offload path to confirm the other problem size works as well.
