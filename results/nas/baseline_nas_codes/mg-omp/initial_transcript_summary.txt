Added OpenMP GPU offload across MG kernels: introduced target data mapping for `u/v/r`, offloaded all heavy 3D loops with `target teams loop`, and replaced temporary buffer handling with device-mapped allocations for psinv, resid, rprj3, and interp. Boundary exchange, zeroing, and norm calculations now run on the GPU, with host/device synchronization handled via OpenMP directives. Initialization and execution stay within a single target data region for reduced transfers.

Key file: `data/src/mg-omp/mg.c`

Commands run:
- `make clean`
- `make CC=nvc++ CLASS=A`
- `./mg.A.x` (passes verification, Class A)

Warnings are from legacy string literals and unused locals; runtime completes and verifies successfully.
