- Copied the serial reference `golden_labels/src/ep-serial/ep.c` unchanged into `data/src/ep-omp/ep.c` so the GPU/offload directory contains the same source as the golden reference.  
- Added `data/src/ep-omp/analysis.md`, which documents the loop-nesting tree and per-loop details (e.g., the timed chunk loop at `data/src/ep-omp/ep.c:134`, the RNG-dependent inner loops at `:153`/`:194`, and the histogram accumulation at `:211`) along with the priority/type classification, dependencies, and issues such as needed atomics for `v61`.  
- Highlighted that the per-sample work (`for (v42 = 1; …)` and its child loops) is the dominant compute kernel, that the RNG streams are sequential yet replicable, and that the histogram bin loop must guard updates to `v61` (analysis file, Tabular summary).

Next steps you may want to take:  
1. Use the analysis to design the GPU/OpenMP offload plan (parallelize the outer chunk/sample loops, keep the sequential RNG streams per thread, and consider atomic/bin-local reductions for `v61`).  
2. Investigate whether the reduction over `v61` (`data/src/ep-omp/ep.c`:232) can be done with per-bin partials before combining into `v59` to avoid atomics on the device.
