- Copied `golden_labels/src/cg-serial/cg.c` into `data/src/cg-omp/` so the kernel directory now mirrors the serial source without edits.
- Added `data/src/cg-omp/analysis.md` that enumerates the timed loops (with types, parents, reductions, and CSR issues), provides a summary table, and captures array/data-layout observations for the CG benchmark.

Next steps:
1. Use the documented loop priorities/data dependencies to guide the OpenMP offload sketch and ensure reductions/CSR gathers are handled correctly.
2. If desired, run the existing `Makefile` targets under `data/src/cg-omp` to confirm the copied source still builds (not executed here).
