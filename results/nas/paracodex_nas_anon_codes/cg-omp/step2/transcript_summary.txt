- Fused the SpMV/dot, update/dot, and final SpMV/norm loops inside `data/src/cg-omp/cg.c:594-647`, keeping all `is_device_ptr` mappings while caching per-row scalars (`row_val`, `y_val`, `diff`) so each CG iteration now dispatches three heavier kernels instead of five and keeps the reductions on-device.
- Captured the profiling-driven rationale, fusion targets, and the before/after runtimes plus micro-op notes in `data/src/cg-omp/optimization_plan.md#L1-L65`.
- Tests: `timeout 300 env OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY make CC=nvc++ CLASS=S run` (see `data/src/cg-omp/current_output.txt#L61-L109` for the full log, verification success at `#L97`, and the 0.11s runtime at `#L106`).

Suggestions:
1. Profile the optimized binary with `env OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY nsys profile … make CC=nvc++ CLASS=S run` to regenerate `profile.log` and confirm the fused kernels now own the majority of GPU time with fewer launches.
2. Apply the same fusion strategy to higher classes (e.g., CLASS B) to verify that the reduced launch overhead and register-conscious reductions continue to pay off as `NA`/`NZ` scale up.
