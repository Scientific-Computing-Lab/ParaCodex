Implemented GPU-ready OpenMP offload for the rotation kernel with device-resident tiling and workspace management.  
- `data/src/matrix-rotate-omp/main.cpp:10-35`: added serial forward declaration plus device selection/fallback logic; we now bail early to the CPU path if `omp_get_num_devices()` reports zero, keeping correctness when no accelerator is visible.  
- `data/src/matrix-rotate-omp/main.cpp:43-76`: introduced a single `target data` region that maps the matrix once, allocates a device workspace via `map(alloc:…)`, and performs the rotation in-place on the GPU using tiled `target teams distribute` + `parallel for` for better cache/coalescing behavior before copying results back.  
- `data/src/matrix-rotate-omp/main.cpp:35-84`: switched to host `malloc` for the scratch buffer (to avoid device allocation failures under the current runtime) and ensured timing covers only the offloaded iterations.  
- `data/src/matrix-rotate-omp/main.cpp:87-150`: preserved the serial validator and main driver, so correctness checking against the GPU path stays unchanged.

Tests: `make -f Makefile.nvc clean`, `make -f Makefile.nvc`, `make -f Makefile.nvc run` (runtime reported no devices, so the guarded serial fallback executed with zero kernel time).  

Next steps:  
1) Re-run on a system where `omp_get_num_devices()>0` to capture real GPU timings and profile with Nsight Compute for further tuning (tile size, team/thread limits).
