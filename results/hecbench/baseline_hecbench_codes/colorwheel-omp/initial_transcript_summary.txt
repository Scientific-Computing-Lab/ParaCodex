**OpenMP Offload Update**
- Replaced the per-call color wheel construction with a single host initialization and shared GPU-visible storage via `#pragma omp declare target`, keeping the normalized palette accessible on both CPU and GPU (`data/src/colorwheel-omp/main.cpp:11-69`).
- Host path now builds the reference image once while the main compute loop is executed inside an OpenMP `target data` region, mapping the color wheel and output buffer and launching a collapsed 2-D `target teams distribute parallel for` per repeat (`data/src/colorwheel-omp/main.cpp:107-146`).
- Added device-safe math usage and clamping in `computeColor`, plus retained the original correctness check comparing host and device buffers (`data/src/colorwheel-omp/main.cpp:45-160`).
- Build succeeds after `make -f Makefile.nvc clean && make -f Makefile.nvc`; runtime testing here fails with `CUDA_ERROR_OPERATING_SYSTEM` because the sandboxed WSL environment has no accessible GPU—please rerun on a system with a working CUDA stack.

Next steps:
1. Execute `./main <range> <size> <repeat>` on a GPU-enabled host to confirm execution.
2. Profile the new kernel with Nsight Compute (`ncu`) to tune team/thread geometry if needed.
