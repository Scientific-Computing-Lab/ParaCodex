**Results**
- Introduced GPU-aware launch configuration helpers and bit-length utility so kernels size teams appropriately for the target device (`data/src/bsearch-omp/main.cpp:12-34`).
- Reworked each binary-search variant into an OpenMP target region with persistent data mapping to amortize transfers and parallelize the per-query searches across teams/threads (`data/src/bsearch-omp/main.cpp:36-213`).
- Retained host setup/verification while wiring it to the new device kernels, preserving the original workflow and data layout (`data/src/bsearch-omp/main.cpp:230-284`).

**Build**
- `make -f Makefile.nvc clean && make -f Makefile.nvc` (success).

**Next Steps**
1. Run `./main <elements> <repeat>` to validate numerics on the GPU.
2. Profile the kernels with `ncu` to confirm occupancy, memory efficiency, and guide further tuning.
