OPT Advice:
    OPT   This workload exhibits low compute throughput and memory bandwidth utilization relative to the peak           
          performance of this device. Achieved compute throughput and/or memory bandwidth below 60.0% of peak           
          typically indicate latency issues. Look at Scheduler Statistics and Warp State Statistics for potential       
          reasons.
