**Changes**
- Added an OpenMP offload implementation that keeps the path grid resident on the GPU via `target data`, performs per-row DP relaxation with `target teams distribute parallel for`, and maintains a ping-pong buffer for dependencies (`data/src/pathfinder-omp/main.cpp:72-98`).
- Preserved deterministic setup (seeded initialization and host-side validation) while guarding inputs and staging host/device buffers for the checksum export (`data/src/pathfinder-omp/main.cpp:35-123`).
- Emitted the required GATE checksum over the final row to stay aligned with the reference harness (`data/src/pathfinder-omp/main.cpp:122-123`).

**Status**
- `make -f Makefile.nvc clean` and `make -f Makefile.nvc` both succeed in `data/src/pathfinder-omp/`.
- Runtime check could not be completed here: `cuInit` fails with `CUDA_ERROR_OPERATING_SYSTEM`, indicating the GPU is unavailable in this environment.

**Next Steps**
1. Re-run `./main <cols> <rows> <pyramid_height>` on a node with CUDA initialized (e.g., bare-metal Linux or WSL with GPU passthrough) to confirm the checksum matches the reference.
2. Optionally profile with `ncu --set full ./main ...` to tune launch geometry once a working GPU runtime is available.
