Implemented OpenMP target-offload versions of both mean-shift kernels and wrapped them with a GPU-resident driver so the data stays on device across iterations.

- `data/src/meanshift-omp/main.cpp:27`: replaced the serial baseline with a `target teams distribute` kernel that assigns one point per team, parallelizes the neighbor scan across team threads with array reductions, and caches the reference point locally to cut repeated global reads.
- `data/src/meanshift-omp/main.cpp:73`: reworked the tiled kernel to cooperatively stage tiles into a per-team scratch array with barriers, then reduce contributions across threads via OpenMP reductions, matching the original tiling logic on the GPU.
- `data/src/meanshift-omp/main.cpp:144`: added a reusable driver that maps the working buffers once (`target data`), swaps device pointers through all iterations, and only copies back when the final state resides in the scratch buffer.
- `data/src/meanshift-omp/main.cpp:197`: updated the host flow to reuse the new driver for both kernels, capture timing, and run the existing centroid validation unchanged.

Build: `make -f Makefile.nvc` now succeeds.

Next step: 1) run `make -f Makefile.nvc run` to confirm runtime behaviour on the target dataset.
