**GPU Translation & Optimizations**
- Added an OpenMP `declare target` solution routine so both CPU and GPU share consistent MMS evaluation (`data/src/heat-omp/main.cpp:10`).
- Wrapped the timestep buffers in a persistent `target data` region and initialized them directly on the RTX 4060 (teams of 256 threads chosen for the 128‑FP64/SM balance) (`data/src/heat-omp/main.cpp:95-115`).
- Offloaded the explicit heat-stencil update with double buffering, keeping memory access coalesced while swapping roles each iteration to avoid host/device traffic (`data/src/heat-omp/main.cpp:117-165`).
- Computed the L2 error via an on-device reduction, eliminating the need to repatriate the full grid before reporting accuracy (`data/src/heat-omp/main.cpp:167-201`).

Build: `make -f Makefile.nvc` (after `make -f Makefile.nvc clean`) now succeeds with GPU offload enabled.

Next steps you might consider:
1. Run `make -f Makefile.nvc run` (or launch `./main 4096 1000`) to validate runtime behavior on your target inputs.
2. Profile with `ncu` if you want to tune team sizes or explore shared-memory tiling for larger grids.
