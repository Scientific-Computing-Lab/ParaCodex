**Key Changes**
- Added a GPU-targeted Winograd kernel in `data/src/winograd-omp/main.cpp:10` that maps input/filter/output buffers with `#pragma omp target data`, drives execution with `target teams distribute parallel for collapse(2)`, and times the device section for the reported co-execution metric.  
- Tuned the launch geometry in `data/src/winograd-omp/main.cpp:24` via `thread_limit(256)` (matching the 32×8 tile from system_info) and kept tile-local scratch arrays private so each team processes one 2×2 output patch entirely in registers/L1 for coalesced global accesses.  
- Hardened host control flow in `data/src/winograd-omp/main.cpp:90` by verifying a target device is present, seeding deterministic input generation, and validating GPU results against the existing serial Winograd reference before emitting timing statistics.

**Build**
- `make -f Makefile.nvc clean`  
- `make -f Makefile.nvc`

**Next Steps**
- 1. Run `OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY ./main` inside `data/src/winograd-omp` to sanity-check the GPU result and timings.
