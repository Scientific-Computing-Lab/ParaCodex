**OpenMP GPU Offload**
- Added GPU and CPU helpers plus launch parameters (`kThreadsPerTeam` tuned to 256 threads per team for the cc89 RTX 4060 SM layout) inside an anonymous namespace, keeping the host fallback and device kernel aligned on the same accumulation math (`data/src/stddev-omp/main.cpp:10-40`).
- Wrapped the timed region in a persistent `omp target data` mapping so the large `D×N` matrix stays resident on the device across all launches, then reused the device pointers via `stddev_kernel` for the warmup and timed repeats while copying the result back only once (`data/src/stddev-omp/main.cpp:90-115`).
- Preserved correctness checks by comparing against the provided reference implementation and returned a non-zero exit code on mismatch; CPU fallback continues to run when no accelerator is available (`data/src/stddev-omp/main.cpp:117-134`).

**Commands**
- `make -f Makefile.nvc clean`
- `make -f Makefile.nvc`

Next step: 1) run `make -f Makefile.nvc run` with your target problem sizes to gather performance data.
