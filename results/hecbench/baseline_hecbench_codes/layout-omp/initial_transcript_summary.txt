- data/src/layout-omp/main.cpp:82 and 126 keep AoS/SoA datasets resident on the RTX 4060 by wrapping them in `#pragma omp target data ... use_device_addr(...)`, then launch `target teams distribute` kernels with `num_teams(treeNumber)` / `thread_limit(GROUP_SIZE)` and an inner `parallel for simd reduction` so each tree sum is computed cooperatively across 256 threads while avoiding remapping overhead.
- data/src/layout-omp/main.cpp:31,104-114,147-157 track validation per layout through `overall_fail`/`layout_fail`, reporting mismatches and returning a non-zero status if any GPU reduction disagrees with the serial reference.
- data/src/layout-omp/main.cpp:63-75 preserve the original initialization/reference logic while reusing the allocated buffers for both layouts to minimize host-device transfers.

Build: `make -f Makefile.nvc clean && make -f Makefile.nvc` (done; succeeds).

Next actions:
1. Run `make -f Makefile.nvc run` (or `./main 1`) with your desired iteration count to verify correctness on the target GPU.
2. Profile with `ncu --set full ./main 1` if you want kernel-level metrics for further tuning.
