Converted the dense embedding benchmark to OpenMP GPU offload with persistent device data regions and two tuned kernels for the RTX 4060 Laptop GPU.

- Added reusable GPU helpers: device-side zeroing and the team/thread launch wrappers in `main.cpp:32-109`, mapping each batch to a team and providing an alternate tile-collapsed kernel for better occupancy and coalesced accesses.
- Reworked the main driver in `main.cpp:112-245` to manage device memory explicitly (`target enter/exit data`, `target update`), reset device outputs between repeats, and benchmark both kernels across block sizes while validating against the CPU reference.

Build: `make -f Makefile.nvc`

Suggested next steps: 1) Run the executable (e.g., `./main 10000 8 1`) to confirm runtime behavior. 2) Profile with `ncu` to tune `num_teams`/`thread_limit` per embedding dimension if further performance is needed.
