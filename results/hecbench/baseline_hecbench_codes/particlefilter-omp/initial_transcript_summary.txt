- Implemented device-compatible RNG, rounding, and binary-search helpers with `#pragma omp declare target` so both host and cc89 GPU kernels reuse the same math paths (`data/src/particlefilter-omp/main.cpp:28-70`), keeping the serial bit-exact random stream.
- Offloaded preprocessing loops such as value remapping and noise injection while preserving sequential noise generation for correctness; the maps now run as `target teams` kernels (`data/src/particlefilter-omp/main.cpp:92-131`).
- Wrapped the particle propagation loop in a persistent `omp target data` region and built GPU kernels for motion update, likelihood evaluation, weight reduction, and resampling with tuned `thread_limit(256)` for RTX 4070 SM occupancy (`data/src/particlefilter-omp/main.cpp:277-386`).
- Normalization, CDF construction, and low-variance sampler now synchronize seeds between host and device to match the serial algorithm, then perform GPU-side binary searches for resampling (`data/src/particlefilter-omp/main.cpp:341-386`).
- Preserved final host-side statistics and output generation while reporting kernel/offload timing to aid future profiling (`data/src/particlefilter-omp/main.cpp:390-416`).

Tests:
- `make -f Makefile.nvc clean`
- `make -f Makefile.nvc`

Next steps you might consider:
1. Profile the dilation pipeline and, if it shows up hot, port it to a collision-free target kernel.
2. Use Nsight Compute to validate occupancy and memory throughput of the particle kernel under your production workload.
