**Key Changes**
- `main.cpp:14-90` refactored the Vincenty distance routine into a `declare target` GPU-capable helper with shared constants, so both host and device execute identical math.
- `main.cpp:100-123` replaced the nested serial sweep with an OpenMP `target data` region and `target teams distribute parallel for` kernel (thread_limit 256) that keeps inputs on device across repeats and writes results directly from the GPU.
- `main.cpp:135-199` kept the host-side preparation/verification flow but tightened allocation checks and routed reference calculations through the shared host function for consistency.

**Status**
- `make -f Makefile.nvc clean && make -f Makefile.nvc` succeeds with NVHPC (`-mp=gpu -gpu=cc89`) and reports generated GPU kernel info.

**Next Steps**
1. Run `OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY ./main <repeats>` (or `make -f Makefile.nvc run`) to validate runtime behavior on your dataset.
