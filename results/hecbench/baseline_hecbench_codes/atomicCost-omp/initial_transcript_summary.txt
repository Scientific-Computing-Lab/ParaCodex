**OpenMP Port**
- `data/src/atomicCost-omp/main.cpp:11-37` implements GPU kernels: a collapsed iteration space with `#pragma omp target teams distribute parallel for` plus atomics for the contended variant, and a non-atomic path that assigns each logical thread to one GPU lane with an inner `simd` reduction to avoid atomics.
- `data/src/atomicCost-omp/main.cpp:41-94` manages device memory using scoped `target data` regions so the large result buffers stay resident across repeats, keeps the host allocations zeroed, and preserves the timing/validation workflow while copying results back once.
- `data/src/atomicCost-omp/main.cpp:98-125` adds a target-device availability check (`omp_get_num_devices`) before launching the workloads and retains the original driver logic for FP64/INT32/FP32 measurements.

**Build**
- `make -f Makefile.nvc` (after `make -f Makefile.nvc clean`) ✔️

**Next steps**
- 1. Run `./main 16 16` (or desired arguments) under `OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY` to confirm runtime behaviour and gather profiling data with `ncu` if further tuning is needed.
