**Implementation**
- `data/src/michalewicz-omp/main.cpp:10` now marks `michalewicz_eval` as an OpenMP `declare target` routine and keeps the math in single-precision with a reciprocal-π constant to avoid host-only dependencies.
- `data/src/michalewicz-omp/main.cpp:55` seeds GPU work by filling the random input vectors on the host while keeping the original RNG sequence.
- `data/src/michalewicz-omp/main.cpp:68` configures a 256-thread team size and clamps the dynamic team count to keep SMs on the cc89 GPU busy without oversubscription.
- `data/src/michalewicz-omp/main.cpp:80` uses a single `target teams distribute parallel for collapse(2)` with a `min` reduction, mapping the vector batch once per dimension so all `repeat × n` evaluations run in one kernel launch.

**Build**
- `make -f Makefile.nvc clean`  
- `make -f Makefile.nvc`

Runtime check failed here because the container cannot initialize CUDA (CUDA_ERROR_OPERATING_SYSTEM), so numerical verification on GPU is still outstanding.

**Next Steps**
1. Re-run `./main 500000 100` on a system with NVIDIA drivers enabled to confirm correctness.
2. Profile with `ncu` to fine-tune `num_teams`/`thread_limit` and inspect memory throughput.
