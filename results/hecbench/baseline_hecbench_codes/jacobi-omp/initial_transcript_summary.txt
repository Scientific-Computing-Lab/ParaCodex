**Key Updates**
- Kept initialization on the host and replaced hard-coded `M_PI` usage with a portable constant while preserving boundary conditions (`data/src/jacobi-omp/main.cpp:17`).
- Allocated the working grids with explicit alignment checks and prepared scalar controls for convergence/timing (`data/src/jacobi-omp/main.cpp:34`).
- Wrapped the solver in a `target data` region and offloaded both the Jacobi stencil and the device-side copy-back using tuned `num_teams`/`thread_limit` settings plus a reduction for the RMS error (`data/src/jacobi-omp/main.cpp:60`).
- Reported iteration timing and final status once the loop completes, mirroring the original diagnostics (`data/src/jacobi-omp/main.cpp:98`).

**Build & Run**
- `make -f Makefile.nvc` succeeds.
- Runtime attempt fails early: `cuInit` returned error 304 (`CUDA_ERROR_OPERATING_SYSTEM`), indicating the current environment lacks usable GPU support.

Next steps:
1. Re-run on a CUDA-capable system (or enable GPU passthrough in the current environment) to validate convergence.
2. Profile with `ncu --set full ./main` to check occupancy, memory throughput, and tune `num_teams`/`thread_limit` if needed.
