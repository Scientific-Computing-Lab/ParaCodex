**OpenMP Offload**
- Added an OpenMP target data region with persistent mappings so the stencil runs on the GPU while keeping host copies coherent (`data/src/stencil1d-omp/main.cpp:46-70`).
- Parallelized the main stencil loop across teams/threads with `num_teams`/`thread_limit` tuned to the block granularity, and used an `omp simd` reduction to keep per-thread accumulation efficient (`data/src/stencil1d-omp/main.cpp:49-65`).
- Preserved host-side validation and error handling while tightening argument checks to guard against bad inputs (`data/src/stencil1d-omp/main.cpp:23-105`).

- Build: `make -f Makefile.nvc` ✅
- Runtime check: `./main 1024 5` ❌ (fails with `CUDA_ERROR_OPERATING_SYSTEM`; current environment blocks GPU initialization)

Next steps:
1. Re-run the executable on a GPU-enabled environment (native Linux or WSL with GPU passthrough) to validate correctness and timing.
2. Profile with `ncu --set full ./main <length> <repeat>` once hardware access is available to decide whether tiling into team-shared memory (`omp_pteam_mem_alloc`) would pay off.
