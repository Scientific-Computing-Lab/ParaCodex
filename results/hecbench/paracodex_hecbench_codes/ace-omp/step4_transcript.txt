**Key Updates**
- `data/src/ace-omp/main.cpp:120` precomputes constant factors and rewrites the force kernel to load neighbors once, reuse gradient powers, and form the anisotropy/dFunc terms analytically so we cut duplicate divisions and function calls inside the hot loop.
- `data/src/ace-omp/main.cpp:246` mirrors that approach in the Allen–Cahn update by inlining gradient, anisotropy, and divergence calculations with shared intermediates, reducing arithmetic intensity before the tau and reaction updates.
- `data/src/ace-omp/main.cpp:338` rewrites the thermal diffusion step to manual 7-point Laplacian math using cached reciprocals and a fused diffusion scale for leaner arithmetic per voxel.

**Build / Run**
- `make clean` (target missing in this tree; command fails as “No rule to make target ‘clean’”)
- `make -f Makefile.nvc`
- `make -f Makefile.nvc run` (fails: `cuInit` returns 304 because the sandboxed environment has no usable CUDA driver)

Let me know once you can run Nsight on hardware; the next logical step is to capture fresh SpeedOfLight profiles to confirm the reduced compute load on the RTX 4070 Laptop GPU.
