**GPU Offload**
- Enabled GPU compilation for the stencil/math helpers with `#pragma omp declare target` so the device kernels can invoke them (`main.cpp:22-101`).
- Offloaded the three profiled hotspots—force assembly, Allen-Cahn update, and thermal diffusion—using `#pragma omp target teams distribute parallel for collapse(3)` and explicit 3-D map clauses to move the lattice data between host and device (`main.cpp:110-233`), with brief comments noting each GPU kernel’s role.

**Tests**
- `make clean` (fails: Makefile.nvc has no `clean` rule, but the required attempt was made).
- `make -f Makefile.nvc`

Next step: 1. Run `make -f Makefile.nvc run` (or the provided profiling command) to validate numerics and collect the initial GPU baseline.
