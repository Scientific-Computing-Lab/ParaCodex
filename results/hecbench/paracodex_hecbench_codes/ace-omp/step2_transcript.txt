- Updated all hot kernels to rely on persistent device mappings by switching to `map(present: …)` so the GPU reuses the resident 400³ slabs instead of re-transferring them each launch (`data/src/ace-omp/main.cpp:111`, `data/src/ace-omp/main.cpp:158`, `data/src/ace-omp/main.cpp:219`).
- Offloaded the boundary-condition and swap loops with `target teams distribute parallel for collapse(3)` so halo updates and ping-pong swaps now execute on the device without round-tripping data (`data/src/ace-omp/main.cpp:183`, `data/src/ace-omp/main.cpp:236`, `data/src/ace-omp/main.cpp:261`).
- Wrapped the timestep loop in a single `target data` region that maps `phiold`/`uold` as `tofrom` and allocates the scratch arrays (`phinew`, `unew`, `Fx`, `Fy`, `Fz`) once, keeping the Ada SM 8.9 GPU fed by eliminating repeated HtoD/DtoH copies (`data/src/ace-omp/main.cpp:370`).

No builds or profiles were run.  

Next steps:  
1. `make clean && make -f Makefile.nvc`  
2. `ncu --target-processes all --section "SpeedOfLight" --launch-count 4 make -f Makefile.nvc run` to confirm the expected drop in memcpy time.
