- Restored the provided serial baseline in `data/src/ace-omp/main.cpp` (e.g., double-precision stencil sweeps at `data/src/ace-omp/main.cpp:105`, `145`, `197`) and removed the prior gate instrumentation so the file reflects the original CPU implementation while remaining compilable (`std::sqrt`/`std::exp` supported through `<cmath>`).  
- Documented the profiling-driven GPU offload targets in `data/src/ace-omp/analysis.md`, highlighting the 3D force, Allen–Cahn, and thermal update loops with workload, independence, and locality justifications.

No builds or tests were run; once ready, run `make -f Makefile.nvc clean && make -f Makefile.nvc` to confirm the baseline compiles.
