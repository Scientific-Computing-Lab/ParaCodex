**Key Changes**
- Leveraged the Ada Lovelace GPU (CC 8.9, 24 SMs) specs to supply launch geometry hints that keep ~160 teams per SM: added team-count computation and `num_teams/ thread_limit` clauses for the hot stencil kernel so the runtime forms 256-thread teams over the `n*n` iteration space, improving occupancy while respecting existing maps and data motion (`main.cpp:87`, `main.cpp:98`).
- Applied the same launch-hint pattern plus loop collapsing to the L2 norm reduction, restructuring the inner math to preserve numerical equivalence (`main.cpp:146`-`main.cpp:159`).
- Documented the concurrency tuning with lightweight comments to aid future profiling passes.

**Next Steps**
1. Run `make -f Makefile.nvc clean && make -f Makefile.nvc` to build; instructions require the clean step before compilation.
2. Profile with `ncu --target-processes all --section "SpeedOfLight" --launch-count 4 make -f Makefile.nvc run` and check occupancy/throughput shifts.
