Created the serial baseline in `data/src/heat-omp/main.cpp` with the required OpenMP timing include and recorded GPU offload targets in the requested analysis report.

- `data/src/heat-omp/main.cpp:4` adds `#include <omp.h>` so `omp_get_wtime()` links correctly; the remainder mirrors the provided stencil solver, keeping the initialization loops (lines 67-79) and highlighting the timestep hotspot (lines 85-99) and L2 norm sweep (lines 127-134) for future offload work.
- `data/src/heat-omp/analysis.md` documents why the time-stepping stencil and the L2 norm evaluation are the primary GPU offload candidates, citing their iteration counts, arithmetic intensity, and data-parallel structure.

Next steps: 1. `make -f Makefile.nvc clean && make -f Makefile.nvc` to verify the baseline compiles before starting offload transformations.
