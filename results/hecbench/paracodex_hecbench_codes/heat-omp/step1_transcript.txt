**GPU Offload**
- `main.cpp:10-12` wraps the `solution` prototype in `declare target`, ensuring the device sees the symbol before it is used inside kernels.
- `main.cpp:89-104` offloads the time-stepping stencil with `target teams distribute parallel for collapse(2)` and explicit maps for `u`, `u_tmp`, `r`, `r2`, and `n`, keeping the original update order while executing on the GPU.
- `main.cpp:126-130` decorates the `solution` definition with `declare target` so the GPU kernel can call it directly.
- `main.cpp:136-146` moves the L2 error accumulation to the GPU with an explicit reduction and data maps, while preserving the per-row sequencing of the inner loop.

**Build**
- `make -f Makefile.nvc clean`
- `make -f Makefile.nvc` (passes; existing warning about unused `block_size` remains)

**Next**
1. Run `make -f Makefile.nvc run` (or the provided Nsight Compute command) to confirm runtime correctness and gather the baseline profile for subsequent tuning.
