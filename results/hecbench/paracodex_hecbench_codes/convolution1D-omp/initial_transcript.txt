- Recreated the serial baseline in `data/src/convolution1D-omp/main.cpp` with the provided logic and added `#include <stdint.h>` so `int16_t` is defined when building with the NVIDIA HPC SDK (see `data/src/convolution1D-omp/main.cpp:1-221`).
- Documented the GPU offload candidates in `data/src/convolution1D-omp/analysis.md`, highlighting the hottest loops with rationale covering work volume, independence, and memory locality.

Next step: `make -f Makefile.nvc clean` followed by a build to confirm the checkpoint compiles before moving on.
