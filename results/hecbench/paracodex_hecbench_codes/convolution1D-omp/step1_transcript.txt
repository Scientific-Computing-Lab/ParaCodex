**Changes**
- Wrapped the scalar stencil in an OpenMP `target teams distribute parallel for` with explicit maps so `mask`/`in` are moved to the GPU and `out` is copied back, giving a correct offload for all data types (`main.cpp:82-94`).
- Offloaded the tiled variant by moving its outer block loop to the GPU, creating a team-private scratch tile inside the kernel and keeping the halo logic intact (`main.cpp:107-138`).
- Reworked the caching path so each team stages a tile on device memory before computing its outputs, preserving the original per-block reuse semantics while running entirely on the GPU (`main.cpp:149-175`).

**Build**
- `make -f Makefile.nvc clean && make -f Makefile.nvc` (pass, targets cc89 as expected for the RTX 4070 Laptop GPU)

**Next Steps**
1. Run `ncu --target-processes all --section "SpeedOfLight" --launch-count 4 make -f Makefile.nvc run` to satisfy the profiling return-code requirement.
