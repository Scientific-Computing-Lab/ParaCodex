**Key Changes**
- Reworked `conv1d_tiled` to assign one tile per team and let all 256 threads cooperate on staging halos and outputs; adds team-shared scratch arrays plus strided loads/stores and an inner `simd` reduction to improve memory locality and arithmetic density (`data/src/convolution1D-omp/main.cpp:112-159`).
- Applied the same team-cooperative pattern to `conv1d_tiled_caching`, staging both the working set and mask once per team and reusing cached values for in-tile accesses while preserving the fallback to global memory (`data/src/convolution1D-omp/main.cpp:172-217`).
- Added per-team bookkeeping (tile limits, block end, cached mask) so boundary tiles handle partial ranges without extra branches, keeping semantics intact while reducing control divergence.

**Verification**
- `make clean -f Makefile.nvc`
- `make -f Makefile.nvc`
- `make -f Makefile.nvc run` *(fails: `CUDA_ERROR_OPERATING_SYSTEM` — GPU unavailable in current environment)*

Next: once the GPU is accessible, rerun `make -f Makefile.nvc run` and profile with `ncu --target-processes all --section "SpeedOfLight" --launch-count 4 make -f Makefile.nvc run` to confirm the expected latency reductions.
