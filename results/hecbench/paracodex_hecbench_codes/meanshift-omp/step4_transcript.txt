Cached redundant global reads inside both GPU kernels so each thread works from register-resident point/neighbor data, addressing the low memory-utilization warnings.

**Code**
- `data/src/meanshift-omp/main.cpp:25` cached the query point coordinates per thread and reused them for distance checks and fallback writes, eliminating repeated `data[row + j]` loads.
- `data/src/meanshift-omp/main.cpp:39` staged neighbor coordinates locally before applying the kernel weight, so each neighbor row is fetched from global memory only once.
- `data/src/meanshift-omp/main.cpp:80` applied the same register caching for the tiled kernel and reused the staged neighbor values when accumulating the weighted position update.

**Build**
- `make -f Makefile.nvc clean`
- `make -f Makefile.nvc`

**Next steps**
1. Profile with `ncu --target-processes all --section "SpeedOfLight" --launch-count 4 make -f Makefile.nvc run` to confirm the latency reduction on the Ada (SM 8.9) GPU.
