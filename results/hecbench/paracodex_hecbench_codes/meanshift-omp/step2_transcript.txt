- Switched both GPU kernels to `map(present, …)` qualifiers so the SM 8.9 device reuses existing allocations instead of remapping each launch (`data/src/meanshift-omp/main.cpp:21-65`).
- Wrapped the `NUM_ITER` loops for the base and tiled solvers in `target data` regions that map `result_ptr`/`buffer_ptr` once, keeping the 15k-float working sets resident on the GPU across swaps and documenting the rationale (`data/src/meanshift-omp/main.cpp:142-193`).
- Confirmed the code builds with the NVIDIA HPC SDK: `make -f Makefile.nvc clean` then `make -f Makefile.nvc`.

Next steps:
1. Run `ncu --target-processes all --section "SpeedOfLight" --launch-count 4 make -f Makefile.nvc run` to verify HtoD/DtoH traffic dropped as expected.
