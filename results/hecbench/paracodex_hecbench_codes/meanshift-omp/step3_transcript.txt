**Concurrency Tuning**
- Added explicit `num_teams(teams)`/`thread_limit(threads)` plus `schedule(static, 1)` to both OpenMP target regions so the runtime now launches ~N (=5000) teams with 64 threads each, addressing Nsight’s low-wave occupancy warning on the RTX 4060 Laptop GPU (SM 8.9) (`data/src/meanshift-omp/main.cpp:19`, `data/src/meanshift-omp/main.cpp:62`).
- Documented the launch hints in-code to capture the Ada-class hardware rationale and keep the BLOCKS/THREADS geometry clear to future readers (same refs).

No additional loop collapsing was introduced: the inner loops inside each point update carry per-thread accumulation state, so collapsing them would break correctness.

Next steps:  
1. `make -f Makefile.nvc clean && make -f Makefile.nvc`  
2. `ncu --target-processes all --section "SpeedOfLight" --launch-count 4 make -f Makefile.nvc run`
