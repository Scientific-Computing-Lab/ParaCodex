Offloaded both mean-shift kernels with OpenMP target pragmas and explicit data mapping so each point update runs on the GPU while preserving the original math (`main.cpp:21`, `main.cpp:63`).  
Ensured thread-private state by moving the tile buffer inside the parallel loop and documenting the intent for clarity (`main.cpp:67`).  
Build passes with the required sequence (`make -f Makefile.nvc clean && make -f Makefile.nvc`).

Next step: 1) run `make -f Makefile.nvc run` to confirm numerical parity under offload before moving to performance tuning.
