- Added the provided serial implementation to `data/src/meanshift-omp/main.cpp`, keeping only an extra `<array>` include so it builds cleanly with the existing Makefile.
- Documented GPU offload candidates and rationale in `data/src/meanshift-omp/analysis.md`, highlighting the two dominant `O(N^2)` loop nests.
- Tests not run (serial baseline only). Suggested next step: `make -f Makefile.nvc clean && make -f Makefile.nvc` once you’re ready to build.
