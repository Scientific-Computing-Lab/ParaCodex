Reworked the GPU kernel in `benchmark_func` to cut redundant global traffic and register pressure in line with the Ada (SM 8.9) latency profile.

- `data/src/mixbench-omp/main.cpp:14-55` – Marked `cd` as `__restrict__`, flattened the launch space into a fused-team loop with `collapse(2)` to align `num_teams(grid_dim*fusion_degree)` with the hardware, and reshaped the inner work so each thread processes pairs sequentially in registers. This removes the temporary array, eliminates seven redundant stores per iteration, and keeps coalesced loads while tightening the live register set for better occupancy.
- `data/src/mixbench-omp/main.cpp:36-49` – Added an explicit unroll hint on the granularity loop and paired compute iterations to maintain arithmetic intensity without inflating register usage, matching the memory-latency bottleneck highlighted by Nsight.

Build/Run status:
- `make -f Makefile.nvc clean` (required pre-build) – ok
- `make -f Makefile.nvc` – ok
- `make -f Makefile.nvc run` – fails (`CUDA_ERROR_OPERATING_SYSTEM` from `cuInit`, GPU not available in this session)

Suggested next steps:
1. Re-run `make -f Makefile.nvc run` once the GPU is accessible to confirm PASS.
2. Profile with `ncu --target-processes all --section "SpeedOfLight" --launch-count 4 make -f Makefile.nvc run` to verify the expected drop in memory bandwidth pressure and improved SM occupancy.
