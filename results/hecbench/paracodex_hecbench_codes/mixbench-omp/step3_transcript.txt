**Kernel Tuning**
- data/src/mixbench-omp/main.cpp:17 collapsed the team/thread/fusion loops and added `num_teams(grid_dim * fusion_degree)` plus `thread_limit(block_dim)` so the SM 8.9 GPU sees 4× more parallel iterations while keeping the original math intact.
- data/src/mixbench-omp/main.cpp:57 reused the explicit launch geometry for the zero-initialization pass, ensuring the 8M-element setup phase also dispatches enough teams to keep the device busy.

**Build**
- `make -f Makefile.nvc clean` → ok
- `make -f Makefile.nvc` → ok (nvc++ reports kernels honoring the new launch bounds)

**Next steps**
1. Profile with `ncu --target-processes all --section "SpeedOfLight" --launch-count 4 make -f Makefile.nvc run` to confirm the occupancy and timing gains.
