**Data Mapping**
- main.cpp:19 switched the compute kernel to `map(present: cd[0:vector_size])` and kept loop-scoped state `firstprivate`, so the device reuses the persistent allocation instead of remapping each launch.
- main.cpp:58 initialization kernel now uses `map(present: cd[0:size])`, keeping `cd` resident on the RTX 4060 Laptop GPU (SM 8.9) across kernels and eliminating implicit host↔device traffic.

Tests not run (build was not requested). Compile with the required clean step before validation.

Next steps:
1. `make clean && make -f Makefile.nvc`
2. `ncu --target-processes all --section "SpeedOfLight" --launch-count 4 make -f Makefile.nvc run`
