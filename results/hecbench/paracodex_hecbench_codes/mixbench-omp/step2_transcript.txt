**Key Updates**
- Converted `benchmark_func` to rely on the persistent device allocation by swapping the per-launch `map(tofrom:…)` for `is_device_ptr(cd)` and silencing the now-unused size parameter, preventing redundant H2D traffic on the Ada (CC 8.9) GPU (`data/src/mixbench-omp/main.cpp:14-40`).
- Wrapped the entire benchmark in a structured `target data map(alloc: cd[0:size])` region, initialized `cd` in-place on the device, and added a single `target update from` before host validation so the array stays resident across all kernels (`data/src/mixbench-omp/main.cpp:55-78`).
- Added a brief comment documenting the intent so future tuning passes know the data region is deliberate (`data/src/mixbench-omp/main.cpp:57`).

**Status**
- `make clean` is not defined in this project (`make: *** No rule to make target 'clean'.  Stop.`), so I stopped short of rebuilding per the constraint. No compilation or profiling has been run yet.

**Next Steps**
1. If acceptable, add a `clean` rule to the makefile or confirm it’s okay to skip; then run `make -f Makefile.nvc` followed by `ncu --target-processes all --section "SpeedOfLight" --launch-count 4 make -f Makefile.nvc run` to validate the reduced transfer volume.
