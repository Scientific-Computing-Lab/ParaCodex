- Added the provided serial baseline (with the required `omp.h` include so it compiles under the NVHPC toolchain) to `data/src/mixbench-omp/main.cpp` beginning at main.cpp:1.
- Recorded the offload-target analysis in `data/src/mixbench-omp/analysis.md`, highlighting the heavy fused loop in `benchmark_func` (main.cpp:22-41) and the array initialization sweep (main.cpp:51) as the top GPU candidates.

Next steps:
1. Run `make -f Makefile.nvc clean` inside `data/src/mixbench-omp/`.
2. Build with `make -f Makefile.nvc` to confirm the baseline compiles before moving on to offload work.
