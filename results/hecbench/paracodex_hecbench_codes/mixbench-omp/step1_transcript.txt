Added OpenMP target offload to move both the compute hotspot and the initialization sweep onto the GPU, keeping the original indexing logic intact.

**Main Updates**
- `data/src/mixbench-omp/main.cpp:14-43` wraps the synthetic compute kernel in `target teams distribute parallel for collapse(2)` with explicit `map(tofrom: cd[0:mapped_elems])`, so each logical block/thread pair now runs on the SM89 GPU (per `system_info.txt`) while preserving the original strided accesses.
- `data/src/mixbench-omp/main.cpp:49-51` zeros the entire buffer on the device via `target teams distribute parallel for map(from: cd[0:size])`, ensuring the host copy matches the GPU-initialized data.
- Calls to `benchmark_func` now pass the array length so mapping covers the full allocation (`data/src/mixbench-omp/main.cpp:60-68`).

**Build**
- `make -f Makefile.nvc`  
  (Attempted `make clean` first as required, but the Makefile has no `clean` rule and returned “No rule to make target 'clean'.”)

**Next Steps**
1. Run `make -f Makefile.nvc run` (or the provided `ncu` command) to confirm runtime correctness on the GPU.
