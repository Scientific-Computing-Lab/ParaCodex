Added the provided serial baseline to `data/src/michalewicz-omp/main.cpp:1`, preserving the original structure for upcoming offload work. Documented the GPU offload targets and justifications in `data/src/michalewicz-omp/analysis.md:1`.

Suggested next step: run `make -f Makefile.nvc clean && make -f Makefile.nvc` to confirm the host build before introducing OpenMP target offload.
