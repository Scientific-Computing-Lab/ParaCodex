Pinned the GPU launch geometry to 256-thread teams sized by the flattened workload so the RTX 4060 Laptop GPU (SM 8.9) sees a steadier stream of concurrent work.

**Key Changes**
- data/src/michalewicz-omp/main.cpp:7 added `<climits>` so we can safely clamp the runtime-computed team count against `INT_MAX`.
- data/src/michalewicz-omp/main.cpp:78-86 derived the total iteration space (`repeat * n`) and rounded it by the chosen team size, ensuring at least one team even for tiny workloads.
- data/src/michalewicz-omp/main.cpp:78 documented the tuning choice so future profiling can revisit it with updated hardware data.
- data/src/michalewicz-omp/main.cpp:90-92 applied `num_teams`, `thread_limit`, and `num_threads` to the collapsed target loop while keeping the existing reduction and privatization semantics intact.

**Build/Verification**
- `make clean` (required pre-build step) currently has no rule in this directory and fails; after that, `make -f Makefile.nvc` completes successfully.

**Next Steps**
- Run `ncu --target-processes all --section "SpeedOfLight" --launch-count 4 make -f Makefile.nvc run` (attempt `make clean` first even though it reports “No rule to make target ‘clean’”) to confirm occupancy and timing improvements with the new launch geometry.
