**Key Changes**
- Replaced the device-side Michalewicz evaluator with templated, unrolled specializations and a generic fallback, switching the `powf(x,20)` call to an explicit multiply chain to lower SFU latency while preserving math semantics; also added a reusable `1/π` constant and `__restrict__` hints for cleaner codegen (`data/src/michalewicz-omp/main.cpp:12-64`).
- Left the host/offload control flow untouched so existing team geometry and reductions continue to match the profiled configuration (`data/src/michalewicz-omp/main.cpp:97-157`).

**Build**
- Ran `make -f Makefile.nvc clean` (plain `make clean` is not defined) followed by `make -f Makefile.nvc`; the build succeeds with the NVIDIA HPC compiler.

**Next Steps**
1. Re-profile with `ncu --target-processes all --section "SpeedOfLight" --launch-count 4 make -f Makefile.nvc run` to confirm the reduced math latency shows up in the Speed of Light metrics.
