Baseline main.cpp restored and documented the GPU offload hotspots you’ll want to focus on next.

- Added the provided serial implementation to `data/src/particlefilter-omp/main.cpp:1`, keeping the logic intact and only appending `<omp.h>` so it continues to compile under `make -f Makefile.nvc`.
- Wrote the required hotspot report in `data/src/particlefilter-omp/analysis.md`, highlighting the high-arithmetic particle update loop (`particleFilter` lines 247-339) and the resampling loop (`particleFilter` lines 364-408) as the best GPU targets given their `(Nfr-1)·Nparticles` grain, independence, and contiguous array access.

Next step: move on to Step 2 to plan the offload strategy for those loops (remember to run `make -f Makefile.nvc clean` before the first build).
