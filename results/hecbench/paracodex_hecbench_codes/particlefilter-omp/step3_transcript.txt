**Concurrency Tuning**
- data/src/particlefilter-omp/main.cpp:253-275 add GPU-aware tuning knobs (`threads_per_team`, `team_count_hint`) sized for the 24-SM RTX 4060 Laptop GPU so each launch requests ~8 waves while keeping team size to 128 threads for better occupancy.
- data/src/particlefilter-omp/main.cpp:289-375,394-409 update every hot `target teams distribute` region to use `num_teams(team_count_hint)` with the new thread limit, and parallelize the stratified `u` vector fill with its own teams launch to keep the device busy once `u[0]` is computed.

**Notes**
- Nested loops inside the propagate kernel remain uncollapsed because they update particle-local RNG state and likelihood reductions that would break numerical semantics if reordered.

**Next Steps**
1. `make clean && make -f Makefile.nvc`
2. `ncu --target-processes all --section "SpeedOfLight" --launch-count 4 make -f Makefile.nvc run`
