Converted the particle filter hotspots to OpenMP target offload with explicit GPU data management so the kernels now run on the device while preserving the original math.

- Defined helper lengths used by the map clauses so every buffer passed to the GPU has an explicit extent (`data/src/particlefilter-omp/main.cpp:239`).
- Wrapped the per-particle propagate/likelihood loop in `#pragma omp target teams distribute parallel for` with full data maps and a weight reduction, mirroring the original random updates and index build on device (`data/src/particlefilter-omp/main.cpp:264`).
- Normalized weights on the GPU by offloading the scale loop and mapping the scalar normalization factor down to the device (`data/src/particlefilter-omp/main.cpp:332`).
- Ran the CDF build and stratified sample generator inside a `#pragma omp target` block so their state remains on the device while keeping the original sequential order (`data/src/particlefilter-omp/main.cpp:341`).
- Offloaded the resampling loop so particle state copies execute on the GPU with mapped inputs/outputs, keeping the resample search identical (`data/src/particlefilter-omp/main.cpp:380`).

Verification:
- `make -f Makefile.nvc clean`
- `make -f Makefile.nvc`

Next steps:
1. Run `make -f Makefile.nvc run` (and the provided `ncu` command) to confirm runtime behavior and collect profiling data now that the kernels offload correctly.
