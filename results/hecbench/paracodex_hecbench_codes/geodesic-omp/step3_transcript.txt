Targeted the GPU launch geometry to better match the RTX 4060 Laptop GPU (SM 8.9) occupancy profile while preserving the existing workload and math.

- data/src/geodesic-omp/main.cpp:95-176: Introduced `threads_per_team=256`/`teams_per_grid` tuning so the OpenMP `target teams distribute` kernels launch 8-warp teams, which balances register pressure and keeps the Ada SMs saturated; applied to both “present” and “target data” execution paths to cover all GPU launches.
- data/src/geodesic-omp/main.cpp:321-335: Reused the same launch geometry for the reference-distance kernel inside the persistent `target data` region, keeping residency logic intact and giving the runtime a single, larger iteration space; verified no additional loops were safe to collapse because each iteration writes the same output element.

Next steps:
1. From `data/src/geodesic-omp`, run `make clean && make -f Makefile.nvc`.
2. Profile with `ncu --target-processes all --section "SpeedOfLight" --launch-count 4 make -f Makefile.nvc run` to confirm the tuned concurrency improves throughput.
