- Placed the provided serial implementation (with the required `<algorithm>` include) into `data/src/geodesic-omp/main.cpp:1` so the project builds from the supplied baseline.
- Logged the GPU offload candidate assessment in `data/src/geodesic-omp/analysis.md:1`, identifying the compute-heavy `distance_device` loop and the verification sweep as the top targets.

Next: set up OpenMP target mapping for the primary loop and plan data movement strategy before introducing GPU pragmas.
