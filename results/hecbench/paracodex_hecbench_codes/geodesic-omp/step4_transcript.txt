**Key Updates**
- Added shared Vincenty constants and an inline solver so both host and device reuse the same math, keeping everything in single precision and trimming redundant temporaries (`data/src/geodesic-omp/main.cpp:19`, `data/src/geodesic-omp/main.cpp:27`). This keeps register pressure predictable on the Ada SM 8.9 target while improving maintainability.
- Simplified the GPU kernel to issue a single coalesced `float4` load per thread and delegate the computation to the declared-target routine, with restrict-qualified pointers to help the compiler keep values in registers (`data/src/geodesic-omp/main.cpp:108`, `data/src/geodesic-omp/main.cpp:125`).
- Enabled overlap between the reference and primary kernels by launching the reference run with `nowait` and inserting a `taskwait` before the results are copied back, so Nsight should now show both kernels sharing memory bandwidth instead of running strictly back-to-back (`data/src/geodesic-omp/main.cpp:235`, `data/src/geodesic-omp/main.cpp:246`).

**Build & Validation**
- `make clean` is not defined in this directory, so the request fails; afterward `make -f Makefile.nvc` compiled successfully with the NVIDIA HPC SDK.

**Next Steps**
1. Profile with `ncu --target-processes all --section "SpeedOfLight" --launch-count 4 make -f Makefile.nvc run` to confirm the overlapped kernels and reduced per-thread math lower the observed DRAM latency stalls.
