- Replicated the provided serial baseline in `data/src/layout-omp/main.cpp` with only the necessary additions (`#include <cstdio>`, `#include <cstring>`, `using uint = unsigned int;`) so it compiles cleanly; the AoS accumulation loop at `data/src/layout-omp/main.cpp:70` and the SoA loop at `data/src/layout-omp/main.cpp:107` remain exactly as in the original specification for later offload work.
- Wrote the required offload-target report in `data/src/layout-omp/analysis.md`, detailing why the AoS and SoA triple-nested reductions are the dominant, embarrassingly parallel workloads and thus the top GPU candidates.

Next steps:
1. Run `make -f Makefile.nvc clean && make -f Makefile.nvc` in `data/src/layout-omp` to confirm the recreated serial baseline builds before introducing OpenMP target regions.
2. Capture a baseline performance profile (e.g., `nsys`) so later GPU offloads can be evaluated against measured CPU execution times.
