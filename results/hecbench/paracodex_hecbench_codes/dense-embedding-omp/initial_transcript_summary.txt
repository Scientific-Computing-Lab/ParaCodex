**Code & Analysis**
- Replicated the provided serial baseline into `data/src/dense-embedding-omp/main.cpp:1-162`, adding only the missing headers (`<cmath>`, `<omp.h>`) so the file can compile under the existing OpenMP-aware Makefile.
- Documented the profiling-driven offload targets in `data/src/dense-embedding-omp/analysis.md`, highlighting the triple-nested reference loop plus the two timed kernel bodies as the primary GPU candidates with justification based on iteration space, arithmetic intensity, and data locality.

**Next steps**
1. In `data/src/dense-embedding-omp`, run `make -f Makefile.nvc clean && make -f Makefile.nvc` once you’re ready to start validating builds.
2. Begin mapping the identified loops onto `omp target teams distribute` regions and re-profile to confirm the expected bottlenecks move to the GPU.
