- Offloaded the timed update loop to the GPU with `target teams distribute parallel for` and per-element atomics so the bitwise/arithmetics on `gpuData` stay numerically identical to the serial version (`data/src/atomicIntrinsics-omp/main.cpp:52`).
- Implemented GPU reductions for the max/min passes using OpenMP `reduction(max|min: ...)`, then wrote the results back to the shared array each repeat iteration to preserve the original control flow (`data/src/atomicIntrinsics-omp/main.cpp:68`, `data/src/atomicIntrinsics-omp/main.cpp:78`).
- Verified the changes build cleanly by running `make -f Makefile.nvc clean` followed by `make -f Makefile.nvc`.

Next step: 1) execute `make -f Makefile.nvc run` (or your usual harness) to confirm runtime correctness before moving on to profiling, 2) profile with `ncu --target-processes all --section "SpeedOfLight" --launch-count 4 make -f Makefile.nvc run` once ready for Step 3.
