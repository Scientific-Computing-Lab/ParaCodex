**Deliverables**
- Replicated the provided serial baseline in `data/src/atomicIntrinsics-omp/main.cpp:1` so the project can build under the existing NVHPC Makefile.
- Documented offload hotspots in `data/src/atomicIntrinsics-omp/analysis.md:1`, highlighting:
  - Loop updating `gpuData` accumulators (`testcase<T>`, lines 50-57) as the primary GPU candidate due to `repeat * 1024` iterations and five ALU ops per iteration that map to atomic/reduction patterns.
  - Max/min reduction loops (`testcase<T>`, lines 59-63) as secondary targets with comparable iteration counts and classic reduction dependencies.

Next, consider running `make -f Makefile.nvc clean && make -f Makefile.nvc` in the same directory to validate the baseline before introducing OpenMP target offload.
