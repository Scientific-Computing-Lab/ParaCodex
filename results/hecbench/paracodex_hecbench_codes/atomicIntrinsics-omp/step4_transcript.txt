**Key Updates**
- Added `#include <omp.h>` to support device-side team queries used for deferred updates back into mapped storage (`main.cpp:5`).
- Replaced three serialized atomic/scan kernels with one fused `target teams` reduction kernel so all per-element work shares a single launch, eliminating repeated `target update` transfers and the prior atomic contention (`main.cpp:58-96`).
- Introduced per-team reduction totals for add/sub/bitwise ops plus max/min, then applied them once from team 0 to preserve the original sequential math while keeping `gpuData` resident on the device (`main.cpp:62-95`).

**Build & Run**
- `make clean` (target missing in this project; kept as required attempt).
- `make -f Makefile.nvc` ✔️
- `make -f Makefile.nvc run` ❌ (`CUDA_ERROR_OPERATING_SYSTEM` under WSL2 sandbox; GPU execution unavailable here).

**Next Steps**
1. When GPU access is available, run `ncu --target-processes all --section "SpeedOfLight" --launch-count 4 make -f Makefile.nvc run` to confirm the fused kernel improves SOL metrics and memory throughput.
2. If further profiling shows under-filled SMs, consider batching multiple repeats per launch or increasing `num_teams` based on the cc89 Ada specs noted in `system_info.txt`.
