Introduced explicit launch configuration to keep the RTX 4060’s 24 SMs busy:
- `data/src/atomicIntrinsics-omp/main.cpp:19-20` adds warp-aligned `threads_per_team` and its derived `teams_for_len`, sized from the Ada Lovelace hardware reported in `system_info.txt`.
- `data/src/atomicIntrinsics-omp/main.cpp:58-87` augments every `target teams distribute parallel for` with `num_teams(teams_for_len)` and `thread_limit(threads_per_team)` so each kernel now launches enough teams to raise occupancy; no nested loops were available for safe `collapse`.

Tests not run (not requested). To verify, run `make clean`, then `make -f Makefile.nvc`, and profile with `ncu --target-processes all --section "SpeedOfLight" --launch-count 4 make -f Makefile.nvc run`.
