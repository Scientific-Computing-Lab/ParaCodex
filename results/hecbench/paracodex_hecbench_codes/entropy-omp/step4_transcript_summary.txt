Restored full-wavefront GPU execution and tightened memory locality so each thread touches contiguous rows before hitting device DRAM.
- `data/src/entropy-omp/main.cpp:11-86` – declared shared target constants and rewrote the baseline kernel to walk rows via cached row pointers, accumulate histogram counts in `unsigned char` bins, and only fall back to `golden_nan()` when a bin is empty; this keeps accesses coalesced and matches the reference semantics.
- `data/src/entropy-omp/main.cpp:91-183` – replaced the previous single-pixel guard in `entropy_opt` with a proper team-tiled launch (`teams distribute` + `parallel for`), added guards for degenerate launches, reused the contiguous row-walk pattern, and switched the entropy math to table lookups only when every bin is populated, otherwise emitting the same NaN as the baseline; the tile structure keeps 16×16 threads resident, which is a good fit for the Ada-class cc89 GPU reported in `system_info.txt`.
- `data/src/entropy-omp/main.cpp:200-244` – extended the device data region to keep both log tables and the output buffer resident across repeats, added a single `target update` at the end, and recorded checksums for both the optimized output and CPU reference so regressions can be spotted quickly.

Verification:
- `make -f Makefile.nvc clean`
- `make -f Makefile.nvc`
- `FORCE_OMP_GPU=1 OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY make -f Makefile.nvc run`

Next steps:
1. Collect the requested profile with `FORCE_OMP_GPU=1 OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY nsys profile --stats=true --trace=cuda,osrt --force-overwrite=true -o nsys_profile make -f Makefile.nvc run` to confirm the memory-latency reductions show up in L1/L2 bandwidth and SOL metrics.
