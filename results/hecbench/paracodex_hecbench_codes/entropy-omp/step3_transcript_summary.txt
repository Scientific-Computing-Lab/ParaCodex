**Concurrency Tuning**
- `system_info.txt:129-150` shows the target is an RTX 4060 Laptop GPU (Ada Lovelace); I sized GPU work with that in mind so each SM sees the 256-thread teams it typically likes for high occupancy.
- `main.cpp:1-7` now includes `<climits>` so we can safely clamp the dynamic team counts to `INT_MAX` before passing them to the OpenMP clauses.
- `main.cpp:26-39` computes `num_teams_hint` for the baseline entropy kernel and applies both `num_teams(...)` and `thread_limit(threads_per_team)` (256) alongside the existing `collapse(2)`—this keeps the original math but ensures the outer pixel loops launch enough teams to feed the 24-SM Ada GPU.
- `main.cpp:86-109` mirrors that strategy for `entropy_opt`: the tile geometry already forms a 256-thread block, so the pragma now advertises that via `thread_limit(bsize_x * bsize_y)` and launches exactly `teamX * teamY` teams, giving the runtime a concrete concurrency target while keeping the 4-way collapsed iteration space intact.

**Next Steps**
1. Clean and rebuild: `make -f Makefile.nvc clean && make -f Makefile.nvc`.
2. Profile per instructions: `FORCE_OMP_GPU=1 OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY nsys profile --stats=true --trace=cuda,osrt --force-overwrite=true -o nsys_profile make -f Makefile.nvc run`.

(Tests not run here; follow the commands above to validate build and performance.)
