Implemented the provided serial entropy benchmark and recorded the required offload analysis.

- `data/src/entropy-omp/main.cpp:1` adds the exact serial baseline (plus the required `<omp.h>` include) so the project builds with `Makefile.nvc`; it mirrors the supplied entropy kernels, timing harness, and reference check.
- `data/src/entropy-omp/analysis.md:1` documents the primary (`entropy` image sweep) and secondary (`entropy_opt` tile loop) GPU offload targets with workload/data-parallel rationale per the requested format.

Tests not run (not requested); next step is to execute `make -f Makefile.nvc clean && make -f Makefile.nvc` to confirm the new source compiles before proceeding to later optimization steps.
