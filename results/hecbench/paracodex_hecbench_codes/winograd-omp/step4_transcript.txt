Reworked the GPU tile loop to favor contiguous loads and shrink on-chip scratch.

- main.cpp:157 iterates tiles in X-major order so neighboring threads access adjacent columns, improving coalescing before the Winograd transforms.
- main.cpp:171 introduces an interior fast path that pulls 4×4 tiles with direct row pointers, falling back to the guarded path only near boundaries.
- main.cpp:203 rewrites the two Winograd transform stages into unrolled scalar passes, eliminating extra intermediate arrays and trimming register pressure.
- main.cpp:256 emits contiguous 2×2 output writes when the tile is interior while retaining precise bounds checks for fringe tiles.

Build: `make -f Makefile.nvc clean` followed by `make -f Makefile.nvc`.

Suggested next steps:
1. Profile with `ncu --target-processes all --section "SpeedOfLight" --launch-count 4 make -f Makefile.nvc run` to measure the memory-latency improvements.
2. Compare GPU/CPU outputs against the host reference to confirm the mixed execution still passes the validation sweep.
