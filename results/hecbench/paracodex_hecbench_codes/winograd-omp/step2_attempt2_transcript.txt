Implementation keeps the GPU output resident and validates in-place so every iteration no longer round-trips device data across PCIe.

- `main.cpp:9-20` adds a small helper to reuse the existing CPU error metric when checking host segments.
- `main.cpp:75-82` warms the reference output once and opens a `target data` region that keeps `A`, `C`, the golden `B_host`, and an `alloc`-backed device buffer for `B` on the cc89 Ada card.
- `main.cpp:113-276` swaps the old `std::min` call for a manual min (keeps NVHPC happy) and, after each GPU launch, runs a tiny on-device validation kernel that only writes a scalar mismatch flag while the CPU segment is checked on the host; the repeated `target update from` was removed accordingly.

Build & test: `make -f Makefile.nvc clean` → `make -f Makefile.nvc` (pass). `make -f Makefile.nvc run` fails under this VM with `CUDA_ERROR_OPERATING_SYSTEM (304)`; rerun on a host with GPU access. Next step: profile with `ncu --target-processes all --section "SpeedOfLight" --launch-count 4 make -f Makefile.nvc run` to confirm the reduction in `[CUDA memcpy]` traffic.
