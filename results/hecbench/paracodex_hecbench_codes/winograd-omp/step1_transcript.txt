**Key Changes**
- `main.cpp:18-41` now allocates a staging buffer, preserves the CPU `rand()` sequence on the host, and uses an OpenMP `target teams distribute parallel for` offload to populate `A` on the GPU with explicit `map(to:/from:)` clauses.
- `main.cpp:98-171` wraps the Winograd tile sweep in an OpenMP target region with `collapse(2)` and `map(tofrom: B[0:output_elems])`, ensuring the device handles the GPU workload while keeping scalars private and reusing the shared size constants.
- `main.cpp:184` frees the new staging buffer so the host memory footprint remains bounded throughout execution.

**Verification**
- `make -f Makefile.nvc clean`
- `make -f Makefile.nvc` (build succeeds; pre-existing warning about `localWorkSize` being unused remains)

**Next Steps**
1. Run `make -f Makefile.nvc run` (or the provided `ncu --target-processes all --section "SpeedOfLight" --launch-count 4 make -f Makefile.nvc run`) to confirm runtime correctness on the GPU.
