**Deliverables**
- Updated `data/src/colorwheel-omp/main.cpp:1` with the provided serial baseline so it’s ready for subsequent offload work.
- Authored `data/src/colorwheel-omp/analysis.md:1` outlining the two heaviest nested loops (`main.cpp:94`–105 and `main.cpp:76`–85) as prime GPU offload targets, with workload, independence, and locality justification.

Suggested next step: run `make -f Makefile.nvc clean && make -f Makefile.nvc` inside `data/src/colorwheel-omp/` to confirm the baseline builds before starting the offload translation.
