**Data Movement**
- Switched the persistent region to `#pragma omp target data map(from : f[...]) map(to : f_old[...])`, so only the converged solution is copied back while `f_old` never leaves the RTX 4060 (Ada, 8 GB) device, matching the hardware layout from `system_info.txt` (`main.cpp:47-86`).
- Added a one-time device kernel to clone `f_old` into `f` on the GPU, eliminating the extra host→device transfer of `f` and keeping both arrays resident for the whole solve (`main.cpp:52-55`).
- Removed the per-kernel `map(present: …)` clauses and rely on the structured data environment, letting the two hot kernels access device-resident data directly while still performing the reduction on `error` (`main.cpp:60-75`).

**Build**
- `make -f Makefile.nvc clean`
- `make -f Makefile.nvc`

**Next**
1. Re-run the provided `nsys` command (`FORCE_OMP_GPU=1 ...`) to confirm `[CUDA memcpy]` time drops and to guide any further optimization.
