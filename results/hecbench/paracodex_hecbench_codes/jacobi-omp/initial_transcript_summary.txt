- Recreated the provided serial Jacobi solver as the new baseline (`data/src/jacobi-omp/main.cpp:1`), preserving structure while adding the missing `<cstdlib>` include so `aligned_alloc` resolves cleanly under `nvc++`.
- Captured the requested offload-target assessment (`data/src/jacobi-omp/analysis.md:1`), highlighting the stencil update, state-refresh copy, and initialization loops with workload, parallelism, and locality justifications.

Verification:
- `make -f Makefile.nvc clean`
- `make -f Makefile.nvc`

Next steps:
1. Begin profiling (e.g., `nsys profile ./main`) to quantify kernel hotspots before introducing OpenMP target offload.
2. Draft a data-mapping plan (arrays, reductions) for the primary stencil loop to guide the next translation step.
