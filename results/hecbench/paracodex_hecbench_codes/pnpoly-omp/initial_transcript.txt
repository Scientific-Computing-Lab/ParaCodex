Created the serial baseline and documented the GPU offload targets. Key updates:

- Added the provided reference implementation to `data/src/pnpoly-omp/main.cpp`, including the heavy point-in-polygon sweeps in `pnpoly_opt` (`data/src/pnpoly-omp/main.cpp:46`) and `pnpoly_base` (`data/src/pnpoly-omp/main.cpp:97`) so future offload work has the correct starting point.
- Captured the offload candidate rationale in `data/src/pnpoly-omp/analysis.md`, detailing why the point/vertex sweeps dominate runtime and are ideal for GPU targeting.

Next: 1) run `make -f Makefile.nvc clean` followed by `make -f Makefile.nvc` to confirm the baseline builds before beginning offload work.
