- Added `omp begin/end declare target` around `is_between` so the helper is available to device code during offload (`data/src/pnpoly-omp/main.cpp:32`).
- Wrapped the hot outer loops in both `pnpoly_opt` and `pnpoly_base` with `omp target teams distribute parallel for` and explicit `map` clauses to move the point/polygon data to the RTX 4070’s SMs and return the bitmaps (`data/src/pnpoly-omp/main.cpp:48`, `103`).
- Inserted an `omp atomic write` on the strided bitmap store to prevent races when multiple GPU threads touch the same element due to the BLOCK_SIZE tiling (`data/src/pnpoly-omp/main.cpp:86`).
- Left brief comments documenting the new offload regions for future tuning passes.

Build: `make -f Makefile.nvc clean` → `make -f Makefile.nvc`

Next: 1) Run `make -f Makefile.nvc run` (or the provided Nsight Compute command) to confirm runtime correctness on the GPU. 2) Begin profiling with `ncu` to guide upcoming optimization steps.
