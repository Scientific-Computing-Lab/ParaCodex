**Changes**
- Offloaded the element-wise `vanGenuchten` kernel to the GPU with `#pragma omp target teams distribute parallel for`, explicit array maps, and `firstprivate` scalars to preserve semantics on device execution (`main.cpp:23`).
- Offloaded the result-check loop, including a `reduction(+:mismatch_count)` and the necessary read-only maps for reference data, so validation now runs on the GPU as well (`main.cpp:108`).

**Build**
- `make -f Makefile.nvc clean` followed by `make -f Makefile.nvc` completed without errors. Target kernels were generated for cc89 as expected.

**Next Steps**
- Run `ncu --target-processes all --section "SpeedOfLight" --launch-count 4 make -f Makefile.nvc run` to confirm the required profiling command succeeds.
