- Recreated the serial baseline in `data/src/vanGenuchten-omp/main.cpp:1` with the provided algorithm, keeping the structure intact while using standard C++ math routines and proper `delete[]` calls for the allocated arrays.  
- Documented GPU offload candidates in `data/src/vanGenuchten-omp/analysis.md`, highlighting the computationally dominant element update loop and the secondary verification sweep.

Next steps:  
1. Run `make -f Makefile.nvc clean && make -f Makefile.nvc` in `data/src/vanGenuchten-omp/` to verify the baseline builds before moving on to offloading work.
