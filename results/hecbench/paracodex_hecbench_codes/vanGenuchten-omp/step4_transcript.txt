- Precomputed device invariants like `theta_diff`, `inv_theta_diff`, `inv_n`, `m_local`, and the `c_prefactor` coefficient so every team/thread can reuse them without re-evaluating expensive divides or `pow` calls (`data/src/vanGenuchten-omp/main.cpp:21-27`).
- Reworked the hot loop to hoist common subexpressions, reuse the shared `base = 1 + (α·|ψ|)^n`, and eliminate an extra `pow` by expressing the derivative term as `1/(base*denom)`; the branch now only performs the costly math when `ψ < 0`, and the `ψ ≥ 0` path short-circuits to the constant results (`data/src/vanGenuchten-omp/main.cpp:49-76`).

Build: `make -f Makefile.nvc clean && make -f Makefile.nvc` succeeds.

Next: 1) run `make -f Makefile.nvc run` followed by the provided `ncu` command to confirm the expected kernel speedup.
