**Key Updates**
- `data/src/pool-omp/main.cpp:83-170` now caches output strides and kernel area constants so each GPU thread reuses precomputed values while iterating pooling windows, reducing integer arithmetic and eliminating the per-iteration `exclusive` branch when the pooling window size is fixed.  
- `data/src/pool-omp/main.cpp:208-264` mirrors the same specialization for the channel-first path, using pointer increments instead of repeated index recomputation and guarding the tiny per-window division behind the `exclusive` path only when needed.

**Build**
- Ran `make -f Makefile.nvc clean` followed by `make -f Makefile.nvc`; build succeeds with the updated CUDA offload kernels.

Next, profile with `ncu --target-processes all --section "SpeedOfLight" --launch-count 4 make -f Makefile.nvc run` to confirm the compute-bound kernel benefits from the reduced arithmetic pressure.
