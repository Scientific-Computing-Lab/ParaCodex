Introduced a persistent OpenMP target data environment so the Keogh sweep reuses data resident on the RTX 4070 (CC 8.9) GPU and avoids per-iteration host↔device transfers.

- data/src/keogh-omp/main.cpp:34 wrapped the timed region in `#pragma omp target data` with `map(to: ...)` for the read-only inputs and `map(alloc: lb[0:N-M+1])` so device memory is allocated once per run.
- data/src/keogh-omp/main.cpp:38 adjusted the kernel launch to `map(present: ...)`, ensuring the Lovelace SMs work on the already-mapped data instead of remapping every repeat.
- data/src/keogh-omp/main.cpp:53 issued `#pragma omp target update from(lb[..])` after the loop to retrieve results exactly once before validation, preserving host correctness while minimizing DtoH traffic.
- Commented the new data region to document the data-lifecycle rationale for future tuning passes.

I did not run the build/profile commands; when you do, remember the required sequence: (1) `make clean`, (2) `make -f Makefile.nvc`, then (3) `ncu --target-processes all --section "SpeedOfLight" --launch-count 4 make -f Makefile.nvc run`.
