Inserted OpenMP target offload for the Keogh lower-bound sweep so each outer-loop iteration now runs on the GPU with explicit mappings for all arrays and a cleaned-up inner index variable to preserve semantics (`data/src/keogh-omp/main.cpp:46`). Added `<omp.h>` to satisfy the offload toolchain include expectations (`data/src/keogh-omp/main.cpp:5`).

Build results: `make clean` is not defined in this tree, so the command fails; afterward `make -f Makefile.nvc` completes successfully with the new kernel emitted by `nvc++`.

Next steps: 1) `make -f Makefile.nvc run` (after acknowledging the missing clean target) to validate the GPU path end-to-end.
