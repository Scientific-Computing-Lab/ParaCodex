**Key Changes**
- data/src/keogh-omp/main.cpp:49 Added explicit `num_teams(grids)` and `thread_limit(blocks)` so each GPU team runs with 256 threads while launching enough teams to keep the RTX 4060 Laptop GPU’s 24 SMs saturated, matching the high-occupancy guidance from the prior Nsight profile.
- data/src/keogh-omp/main.cpp:56 Introduced `#pragma omp simd reduction(+:residues)` on the inner window loop to expose additional lane-level concurrency without altering the per-index accumulation semantics.

**Next Steps**
- 1. `make -f Makefile.nvc clean` (MANDATORY before building).
- 2. `make -f Makefile.nvc`
- 3. `ncu --target-processes all --section "SpeedOfLight" --launch-count 4 make -f Makefile.nvc run` to confirm the tuned launch geometry and check achieved occupancy/throughput.
