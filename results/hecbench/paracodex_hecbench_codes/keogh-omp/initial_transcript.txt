Implemented the provided serial baseline in `data/src/keogh-omp/main.cpp` and documented GPU offload targets in `data/src/keogh-omp/analysis.md`.

- `data/src/keogh-omp/main.cpp:45` hosts the dominant double loop over `idx` and `i`; I flagged it as the primary GPU target thanks to ≈`(N-M+1)*M` iterations with ~9 FP operations and independent writes to `lb[idx]`.
- Initialization loops at `data/src/keogh-omp/main.cpp:32`–`36` touch large contiguous buffers with trivial per-element work, so I captured them as secondary, bandwidth-focused offload opportunities in the analysis report.
- The analysis file follows the requested template and ties each recommendation to workload size, data-parallel independence, and locality expectations for the RTX 4070 Laptop GPU in this system.

Next steps:
1. Run `make -f Makefile.nvc clean && make -f Makefile.nvc` before profiling to confirm the serial baseline builds cleanly.
