Added explicit launch geometry to the GPU target loops to better utilize the RTX 4060 Laptop.

- Tuned both bs kernels with `num_teams(launch_teams)` and `thread_limit(threads_per_team)` plus a bounded team-count calculation so the runtime launches enough teams to keep ~24 SMs busy while respecting CUDA grid limits; see `main.cpp:24` and `main.cpp:88`. No `collapse` clause applied because each offloaded region already has a single work-sharing loop.
- Documented the tuning choice inline to make the reasoning and hardware tie-in clear; same locations as above.

Tests were not run (per instructions, run `make -f Makefile.nvc clean` before rebuilding).

Next steps:
1. `make -f Makefile.nvc clean && make -f Makefile.nvc`
2. Profile with `nsys profile --stats=true --trace=cuda,osrt --force-overwrite=true -o nsys_profile make -f Makefile.nvc run` to confirm occupancy and runtime improvements.
