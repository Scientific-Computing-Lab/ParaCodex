**Key Updates**
- Added OpenMP GPU offload for the hot binary-search loops in `bs` and `bs2`, mapping `acc_a`/`acc_z` as `to` and `acc_r` as `from` so each iteration executes on the device while preserving host semantics (`data/src/bsearch-omp/main.cpp:21-36`, `data/src/bsearch-omp/main.cpp:53-70`).
- Renamed the loop counters to `rep`/`zi` to clarify nesting and ensure the target loop uses a `size_t` trip count, with a short comment noting the new GPU execution context.

**Build**
- `make -f Makefile.nvc clean`
- `make -f Makefile.nvc` (success)

**Next Steps**
1. Run `make -f Makefile.nvc run` (and the provided `nsys` profile command) to confirm device execution and gather baseline performance data.
