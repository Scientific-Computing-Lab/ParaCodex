**Key Updates**
- Added the provided serial baseline (with required headers) to `data/src/bsearch-omp/main.cpp`, preserving the four binary-search variants while ensuring OpenMP symbols resolve (`<omp.h>` is included) and keeping structure ready for profiling.
- Documented offload targets in `data/src/bsearch-omp/analysis.md`, designating the `zSize` query loops in `bs` (`data/src/bsearch-omp/main.cpp:22`) and `bs2` (`data/src/bsearch-omp/main.cpp:52`) as primary GPU candidates with workload, parallelism, and locality rationale.

**Next Steps**
1. Run `make -f Makefile.nvc clean` followed by a build/profiling pass once you’re ready to check correctness and gather baseline metrics.
