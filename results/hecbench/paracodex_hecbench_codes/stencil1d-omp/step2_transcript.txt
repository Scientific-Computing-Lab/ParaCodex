**Data Movement Optimization**
- Moved the repeated kernel launches inside a persistent `target data` region so `a` is copied to the Ada compute-capability 8.9 GPU once and `b` returns only after all repeats, eliminating per-iteration H2D/D2H traffic (`data/src/stencil1d-omp/main.cpp:28-55`).
- Added `map(present: ...)` on the hot target loop to guarantee reuse of the resident buffers and avoid accidental remapping while still leveraging the existing team/thread structure (`data/src/stencil1d-omp/main.cpp:32-53`).
- Documented the data residency change for future tuning passes that might leverage Nsight Compute’s memory stats (`data/src/stencil1d-omp/main.cpp:28`).

I have not built the code here. To validate, run `make -f Makefile.nvc clean` followed by `make -f Makefile.nvc`, then re-profile with `ncu --target-processes all --section "SpeedOfLight" --launch-count 4 make -f Makefile.nvc run`.
