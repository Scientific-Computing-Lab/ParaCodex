**Kernel Tuning**
- `main.cpp:21` derives `num_blocks`, `launch_teams`, and `threads_per_team` so the OpenMP runtime launches at least one team and otherwise mirrors the stencil tiling; sized explicitly for the RTX 4060 Laptop GPU (SM 8.9) to keep SMs busy.
- `main.cpp:40` augments the offload with `num_teams(launch_teams)` and `thread_limit(threads_per_team)`, giving the scheduler an occupancy-friendly launch grid while retaining the existing data mapping.
- `main.cpp:45` consolidates the two nested `parallel for` regions into a single team-local `omp parallel` with ordered `omp for` loops, cutting per-team launch overhead and preserving the shared `temp` tile in fast memory.
- `main.cpp:60` adds `omp simd reduction` inside the stencil accumulation so each GPU thread also exploits SIMD lanes without altering the arithmetic.

**Verification**
- `make -f Makefile.nvc clean`
- `make -f Makefile.nvc`

**Next Steps**
1. `ncu --target-processes all --section "SpeedOfLight" --launch-count 4 make -f Makefile.nvc run` to validate occupancy and throughput improvements on the RTX 4060 laptop GPU.
