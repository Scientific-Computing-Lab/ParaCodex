**Changes**
- Added `TILE_SPAN` to capture the block-plus-halo span as a compile-time constant for the cc 8.9 target, avoiding repeated arithmetic when configuring the team tile (`data/src/stencil1d-omp/main.cpp:10`).
- Reworked the team kernel so every thread participates in a single contiguous tile fill, giving coalesced accesses for the RTX 4060’s 256-thread teams and keeping halos consistent across repeats (`data/src/stencil1d-omp/main.cpp:46`, `data/src/stencil1d-omp/main.cpp:52`).
- Switched the stencil sum to pointer-based iteration with `omp simd`, trimming per-iteration index math while preserving the exact reduction semantics (`data/src/stencil1d-omp/main.cpp:59`).

**Build**
- `make -f Makefile.nvc clean`
- `make -f Makefile.nvc`

**Next Steps**
- `ncu --target-processes all --section "SpeedOfLight" --launch-count 4 make -f Makefile.nvc run`
