- Restored the provided serial stencil baseline so it builds cleanly (`data/src/stencil1d-omp/main.cpp:1`), matching the original behavior and preserving the block-tiling structure we’ll target later.
- Captured the GPU offload rationale in `data/src/stencil1d-omp/analysis.md:1`, flagging the stencil accumulation loop and its halo staging loop as the primary and secondary acceleration targets based on workload, independence, and locality.

Next step: `make -f Makefile.nvc clean && make -f Makefile.nvc` to confirm the baseline still compiles before proceeding to offload work.
