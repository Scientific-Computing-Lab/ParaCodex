Kept the `data`/`std` buffers resident on the GPU across all kernel launches and avoided per-iteration copies by refactoring their OpenMP mappings. In `data/src/stddev-omp/main.cpp:8-18`, the `stddev` kernel now uses `map(tofrom: std[0:D])`, so the device buffer stays alive during the surrounding data region while still copying back once when that region ends. In `data/src/stddev-omp/main.cpp:49-65`, I wrapped the warm-up and timed loops in a single `#pragma omp target data` with `map(to : data[0:N*D]) map(tofrom : std[0:D])`, eliminating the previous `target update` and relying on the region tear-down for the final host transfer; this brings the `std` array back only once after all GPU work is complete.

Build check (after `make -f Makefile.nvc clean` as required):
- `make -f Makefile.nvc`

You can now profile with `ncu --target-processes all --section "SpeedOfLight" --launch-count 4 make -f Makefile.nvc run` to confirm the memcpy reductions and gather new metrics.
