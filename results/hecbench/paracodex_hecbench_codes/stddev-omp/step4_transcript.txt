**Key Changes**
- Added `#include <climits>` and recalibrated the team-count logic to scale with the full `N*D` workset while capping against `INT_MAX`, ensuring we keep four waves per SM even for tall matrices (`data/src/stddev-omp/main.cpp:5`, `data/src/stddev-omp/main.cpp:14-27`).
- Inserted a lightweight GPU kernel to zero the device-resident `std` buffer before every reduction so repeated launches don’t accumulate stale values (`data/src/stddev-omp/main.cpp:29-33`).
- Replaced the column-major sweep with a collapsed `(r,c)` iteration that reads row-major data contiguously and accumulates via `reduction(+ : std[:D])`, improving L1/L2 utilization (`data/src/stddev-omp/main.cpp:35-44`).
- Finished with a dedicated scaling kernel that converts the summed squares into standard deviations on-device, avoiding host-device traffic between passes (`data/src/stddev-omp/main.cpp:46-50`).

**Validation**
- `make -f Makefile.nvc clean`
- `make -f Makefile.nvc`
- `make -f Makefile.nvc run`
