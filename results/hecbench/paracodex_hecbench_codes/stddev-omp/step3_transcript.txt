**Changes**
- data/src/stddev-omp/main.cpp:13-26 introduced tuned launch bounds (`threads_per_team = 256`, `requested_teams` scaled to the RTX 4070’s 46 SMs) so the OpenMP target kernel requests ~4 resident teams per SM and expands if the column count is larger, keeping the GPU saturated while preserving the original math.  
- data/src/stddev-omp/main.cpp:23-25 extended the `target teams distribute parallel for` pragma with `num_teams(requested_teams)` and `thread_limit(threads_per_team)` to feed those hints to the runtime.

**Notes**
- The inner reduction over rows prevents a safe `collapse(2)` without reworking the algorithm; leaving it serial per thread keeps the numerics and avoids atomics.

**Next steps**
- 1) `make -f Makefile.nvc clean && make -f Makefile.nvc`  
- 2) `ncu --target-processes all --section "SpeedOfLight" --launch-count 4 make -f Makefile.nvc run`
