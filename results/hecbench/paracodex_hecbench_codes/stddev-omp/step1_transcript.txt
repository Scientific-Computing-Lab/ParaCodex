**Changes**
- Added an OpenMP `target teams distribute parallel for` offload around the column loop in `stddev` so the accumulation runs on the GPU with explicit mappings for the input matrix, output buffer, and loop bounds; included a brief comment for the new offload block (`data/src/stddev-omp/main.cpp:11`).

**Build**
- `make -f Makefile.nvc clean && make -f Makefile.nvc`

**Next Steps**
1. If we decide to offload the initialization phase later, we will need a device-capable RNG to replace the current `rand()` usage.
