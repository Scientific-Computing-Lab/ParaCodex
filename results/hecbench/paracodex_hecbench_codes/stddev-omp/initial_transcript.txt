Replicated the serial baseline and logged GPU offload targets.

- `data/src/stddev-omp/main.cpp:1` holds the original stddev kernel and driver; the heavy work is the column-wise accumulation loop at lines 11-15 that performs 2 FLOPs per element over the full `N×D` matrix, plus a per-column `sqrtf`, with trivially parallel iterations and regular memory access.
- `data/src/stddev-omp/analysis.md:1` records the offload analysis, highlighting the `stddev` loop as the primary candidate and the dataset initialization loop at lines 38-40 as a secondary opportunity because it writes the entire matrix independently.

Next step:
- 1) Run `make -f Makefile.nvc clean && make -f Makefile.nvc` in `data/src/stddev-omp` to confirm the baseline builds before moving on to GPU offloading.
