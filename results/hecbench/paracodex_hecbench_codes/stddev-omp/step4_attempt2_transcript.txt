**Key Changes**
- Tuned launch configuration for the Ada RTX 4070 by adding a 64-column tile and clamping team count to the number of tiles so we maintain occupancy without over-subscribing SMs (`data/src/stddev-omp/main.cpp:15-34`).
- Replaced the three-stage zero/accumulate/sqrt pipeline with a single tiled target region that keeps column accesses contiguous and performs the reduction within the team before taking the square root, cutting global memory traffic and per-thread scratch space (`data/src/stddev-omp/main.cpp:36-61`).

Build
- `make -f Makefile.nvc` (after mandated `clean`) ✅

Next Steps
1. Run `ncu --target-processes all --section "SpeedOfLight" --launch-count 4 make -f Makefile.nvc run` to validate the expected memory-efficiency gains on your workload.
