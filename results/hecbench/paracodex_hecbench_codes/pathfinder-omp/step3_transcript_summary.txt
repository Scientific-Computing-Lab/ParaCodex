**Concurrency Tuning**
- Precomputed reusable GPU launch hints (256-thread teams plus per-kernel team counts) to keep the iteration space large enough for the device before entering any offload region, so both kernels receive consistent occupancy-aware guidance (`main.cpp:64`, `main.cpp:66`, `main.cpp:71`).
- The initialization kernel retains `collapse(2)` but now adds `num_teams(copyTeams)` and `thread_limit(threadsPerTeam)` so its 2D work is distributed across many teams/threads rather than leaving scheduling entirely to the runtime (`main.cpp:82`).
- The conditional zeroing kernel reuses the same launch parameters via `num_teams(zeroTeams)` and `thread_limit(threadsPerTeam)` to avoid under-populating the GPU when that path executes (`main.cpp:118`).

**Hardware Note**
- Launch parameters were chosen with the local NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Laptop GPU (Ada Lovelace) in mind, as reported in `system_info.txt:131` and `system_info.txt:133`, where 256-thread teams (8 warps) are a good balance for its SMs.

**Tests**
- Not run (not requested). Remember the constraint: run `make -f Makefile.nvc clean` before any build, then follow with the provided `make -f Makefile.nvc` / `make -f Makefile.nvc run` sequence.

**Next Steps**
1. `make -f Makefile.nvc clean`
2. `make -f Makefile.nvc`
3. `FORCE_OMP_GPU=1 OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY nsys profile --stats=true --trace=cuda,osrt --force-overwrite=true -o nsys_profile make -f Makefile.nvc run`
