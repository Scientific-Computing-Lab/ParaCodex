Fused the initialization and parity handling work into a single GPU kernel so the RTX 4060 (Ada) can stream all column-major traffic contiguously and we avoid the extra high-latency launch.

- `data/src/pathfinder-omp/main.cpp:64-107` now flattens the copy into a single `target teams distribute parallel for simd` loop, so every lane walks consecutive `idx` values (better coalescing/L1 hit-rate) while simultaneously populating `gpuSrc`. The parity logic (`needsSrcClear`) is computed once on the host and applied device-side, reproducing the prior “copy then optional zero” behavior without an additional kernel or host `memcpy`. Mapping `gpuSrc` with a `from` clause guarantees the host receives the final row (either the seeded values or zeros) after the kernel completes.
- Removed the host `memcpy`, redundant zero kernel, and the unused team-count bookkeeping, which trims launch latency and eliminates an extra device round-trip (`data/src/pathfinder-omp/main.cpp:77-105,118-137`). Timing now reflects the single hot kernel, and memory is freed only after the device traffic finishes.

Build:
- `make -f Makefile.nvc clean`
- `make -f Makefile.nvc`

Next steps:
1. Re-profile with `FORCE_OMP_GPU=1 OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY nsys profile --stats=true --trace=cuda,osrt --force-overwrite=true -o nsys_profile make -f Makefile.nvc run` to confirm the combined kernel saturates the memory pipelines.
2. If additional bandwidth headroom remains, consider experimenting with a higher `threadsPerTeam` (e.g., 512) now that the kernel is entirely memory-bound on the Ada SMs.
