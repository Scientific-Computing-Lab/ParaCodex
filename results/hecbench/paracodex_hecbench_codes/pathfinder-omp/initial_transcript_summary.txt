- Replicated the provided serial baseline into `data/src/pathfinder-omp/main.cpp:1-200`, adding the missing `#include <omp.h>` so it compiles under `Makefile.nvc` while keeping logic identical for future offload work.
- Documented the profiling-driven offload targets in `data/src/pathfinder-omp/analysis.md:1-9`, highlighting the time-stepping relaxation loop and the grid-initialization sweep as the top GPU candidates with workload, parallelism, and locality justification.

Next steps: 1) Profile the `t`-sweep kernel to quantify memory vs compute balance on the RTX 4060; 2) Sketch the OpenMP target data environment and tiling strategy for that loop before implementing offload.
