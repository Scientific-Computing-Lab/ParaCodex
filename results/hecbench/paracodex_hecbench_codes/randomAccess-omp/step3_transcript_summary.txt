**Concurrency Tuning**
- Added `<algorithm>` plus GPU-aware launch constants (`kRandomStreams`, `kThreadsPerTeam`, `kMaxTeamCount`) so we can express RTX 4060 Laptop (24 SM Ada per `system_info.txt`) occupancy goals directly in code; see `data/src/randomAccess-omp/main.cpp:3-17`.
- Once `TableSize` is known, we now derive one-time team counts that cap at 4 K teams with 256 threads each, ensuring at least ~1 M threads in flight while still respecting the problem geometry (`main.cpp:89-97`).
- The table initialization and final validation reduction kernels take explicit `num_teams(...)`/`thread_limit(...)` hints bound to those derived values, which keeps the large single-loop workloads fully distributed across the GPU (`main.cpp:103-149`).
- The random-update kernel now launches exactly one team per RNG stream with the tuned thread limit and updated `map` slices; the stream count remains 128 to preserve the RNG order, so we forgo loop collapsing because each stream’s updates are inherently sequential (`main.cpp:111-125`).

Tests were not run (not requested); remember the build constraint that `make -f Makefile.nvc clean` must precede any compile.

Suggested next steps:
1. `cd data/src/randomAccess-omp && make -f Makefile.nvc clean && make -f Makefile.nvc` to ensure the tuned pragmas still compile for your toolchain.
2. `FORCE_OMP_GPU=1 OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY nsys profile --stats=true --trace=cuda,osrt --force-overwrite=true -o nsys_profile make -f Makefile.nvc run` to confirm kernel occupancy/time improvements.
