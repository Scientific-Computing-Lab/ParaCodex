- Replicated the provided serial HPCC RandomAccess implementation verbatim into `data/src/randomAccess-omp/main.cpp:1-130`, preserving the profiled structure so later OpenMP target work starts from a clean, compilable baseline.
- Wrote `data/src/randomAccess-omp/analysis.md:1-11` detailing the top three GPU offload candidates (initialization sweep, random update kernel, and error-reduction pass), grounding the rationale in their iteration counts, data-parallel properties, and the RTX 4060 Laptop GPU characteristics from `system_info.txt`.

No builds or tests were run (not requested). 

Next steps:
1. Run `make -f Makefile.nvc clean && make -f Makefile.nvc` inside `data/src/randomAccess-omp` to verify the baseline build before modifying behavior.
2. Sketch OpenMP target mappings for the primary random update loop, including atomic XOR handling, and plan corresponding data-region management for the secondary/tertiary loops.
