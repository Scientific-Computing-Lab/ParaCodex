**Key Changes**
- data/src/randomAccess-omp/main.cpp:15-18 – Increased the RNG stream pool to `16384` (power-of-two that divides `NUPDATE`) and introduced `kLfsrUnroll` so the GPU can keep ~16K concurrent random streams in flight, which greatly improves latency hiding on the RTX 4060 while keeping the math identical.
- data/src/randomAccess-omp/main.cpp:92-99 – Added a reusable `tableMask` constant and capped `numTeamsRandom` at the hardware-friendly `kMaxTeamCount`, so we launch up to 4096 resident teams while the larger logical stream count is scheduled over them without oversubscribing SMs.
- data/src/randomAccess-omp/main.cpp:118-139 – Marked the RNG state transfer as input-only (`map(to: ran[...])`) to drop an unnecessary device→host copy and unrolled the inner update loop (`kLfsrUnroll` chunks) to issue multiple atomic XORs per thread before re-checking loop bounds; this boosts ILP and better overlaps the long-latency random memory traffic. The residual tail loop preserves correctness for non-multiple cases.

**Testing**
- `FORCE_OMP_GPU=1 OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY make -f Makefile.nvc run`

Average kernel time from the run dropped to ~0.40 s per repeat (for 3 repeats), and verification still reports zero errors with the expected checksum.

Next step: rerun the provided nsys profiling command to capture updated SOL/memory metrics with the higher stream count.
