**Tuning Summary**
- Added a `GPU_TEAM_SIZE` constant and explicit `num_teams(...)/thread_limit(...)` pragmas in `data/src/lud-omp/src/lud_omp.c:1-66` so each pivot kernel launches a predictable 256-thread team count that matches the Ada Lovelace (RTX 4060 Ti) warp width we read in `system_info.txt`. Profiling evidence (`data/src/lud-omp/profile.log:1-40`) still shows GPU runtime ~0.044s (CPU ~0.339s), so we tuned purely to keep the triangular kernels well occupied without altering the algorithm.
- Reused row pointers (`row_i`, `row_j`) inside the tuned kernels to avoid repeated `i*size` and `j*size` arithmetic while keeping the `k` reductions serial per thread, ensuring correctness stays identical to the serial version. Runtime verification (`diff baseline_output.txt gpu_output.txt`) only reports the CPU/GPU runtime lines.
- Style-wise this is a hybrid approach: modern OpenMP (`target teams distribute parallel for`) but with conservative manual tuning that respects the triangular dependence and keeps the matrix resident on-device.

**Testing & Profiling**
- `FORCE_OMP_GPU=1 OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY nsys profile --stats=true --trace=cuda,osrt,openmp --force-overwrite=true -o nsys_profile make -f Makefile.nvc CC=nvc++ CLASS=C run > profile.log 2>&1` (profile log shows GPU runtime ~0.044s, but also repeated “SKIPPED … does not contain CUDA/kernel/OpenMP data,” so occupancy and memory-bandwidth numbers are unavailable for these OpenMP target kernels).
- `make -f Makefile.nvc CC=nvc++ CLASS=C run > baseline_output.txt 2>&1` followed by the same command into `gpu_output.txt` (both builds run after the required `make -f Makefile.nvc clean`); outputs still match except for the reported runtimes.
- `diff baseline_output.txt gpu_output.txt | grep -v "Time\|seconds\|Mop"` only flags the CPU/GPU runtime lines (no verification or matrix content differences).

**Next Actions**
- If you need occupancy or bandwidth numbers from the GPU kernels, rerun profiling with a tool that can catch `libomptarget` launches (e.g., Nsight Compute or a different `nsys` capture setup) because the current `nsys_profile.sqlite` omits CUDA/OpenMP events.
- No further code changes are required unless new profiling data suggests another bottleneck.
