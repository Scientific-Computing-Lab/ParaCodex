**Changes**
- Added the `<stdio.h>` and `<omp.h>` headers at `data/src/srad-omp/main.c:24` so the file is self-contained for reporting and OpenMP GPU directives.
- Replaced the legacy GPU stub with a `#pragma omp target data` region at `data/src/srad-omp/main.c:347` that stages `image`, neighbor indices, and coefficient buffers; each GPU iteration now runs three `#pragma omp target teams loop` kernels (ROI reduction, derivative/diffusion, divergence/update) with `collapse(2)` and `thread_limit(256)` to exploit the Ada Lovelace device while honoring the “teams loop” requirement.
- The new block copies the computed `q0sqr` value back to the device via `#pragma omp target update to(q0sqr)` at `data/src/srad-omp/main.c:369`, keeping the diffusion kernels in sync with the latest ROI statistics while keeping intermediary arrays resident on the GPU.

**Testing**
- `make -f Makefile.nvc CC=nvc++ CLASS=B clean`
- `make -f Makefile.nvc CC=nvc++ CLASS=B` (build succeeds; existing warning about `th1` being set but unused in upstream code remains)
- `./main 10 0.5 502 458 1` (GPU runtime 0.002652s vs. CPU runtime 0.015696s, GATE stats reported, and GPU/CPU outputs matched with 0 mismatches)

**Next Steps**
1. Profile the new kernels with `nsys` or another NVIDIA tool to tune `thread_limit`/collapse choices and ensure the teams/threads balance maximizes occupancy on the RTX 4060 Ti.
