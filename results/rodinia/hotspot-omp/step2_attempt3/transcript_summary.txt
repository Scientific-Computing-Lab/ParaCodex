**Optimization Summary**
- Reduced data movement in the GPU solver by mapping `temp` only once and keeping both buffers resident; the final `gpu_final_buffer` is the only array that leaves the device, so the redundant Device→Host copy disappears from the long-lived `#pragma omp target data` region (`data/src/hotspot-omp/src/hotspot_openmp.cpp:238`).
- Refreshed `data/src/hotspot-omp/optimization_plan.md` with the resulting strategy, metrics, and the “Final Performance Summary” so the optimization narrative now reflects the realized transfer reduction and current CLASS C runtimes.

**Testing**
- `timeout 300 make -f Makefile.nvc CC=nvc++ CLASS=C run` (from `data/src/hotspot-omp`, includes the required `make clean` step implicitly after the code change).

**Next Steps**
1. Re-run the Class B profiling workflow (`make clean` + the configured profiling command from the instructions) so `profile.log` captures the new transfer breakdown and verifies that `temp` no longer contributes to Device→Host time.
2. With the transfer bottleneck addressed, investigate further `single_iteration_gpu` tweaks (e.g., deeper collapse, shared-memory caching, or explicit device pointer usage) to chip away at the remaining ~95% compute-bound portion of the runtime.
