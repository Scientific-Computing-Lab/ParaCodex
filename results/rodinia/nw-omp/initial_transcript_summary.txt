Converted the NW kernel to a target-offloaded diagonal sweep while keeping the original CPU fallback, so the GPU path now maps the working matrices once and parallelizes each diagonal through `teams loop` kernels.

- `data/src/nw-omp/src/needle.cpp:1-161`: Added OpenMP headers, kept the scoring tables, and rewrote `runTest_GPU` so the matrix is wrapped in a single `#pragma omp target data` region and both the upper and lower diagonal sweeps execute under `#pragma omp target teams loop thread_limit(256)` for deterministic offload parallelism.
- `data/src/nw-omp/src/needle.cpp:164-208`: Left the CPU version and the dispatching `runTest` untouched so the original correctness path remains (`dev` selects CPU vs. GPU), and kept the init/validation/traceback scaffolding from the reference serial run.

- Tests: `make -f Makefile.nvc clean && make -f Makefile.nvc` (nvc++ compiles the new GPU-aware source); `./main 2048 10 2` (reports CPU 0.0448 s, GPU 0.1680 s, and zero mismatches).

1. Profile the new diagonal kernels with `nsys`/`nvprof` to confirm occupancy and guide any further tuning of `thread_limit` or diagonal chunking.
2. Consider offloading or parallelizing the initialization/referrence setup so data is produced on-device and avoids redundant host-to-device traffic before the main sweep.
