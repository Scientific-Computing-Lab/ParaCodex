- `optimization_plan.md:3-75` now records the actual baseline metrics, the profiling-driven fusion opportunities, and a final summary that lists the measured GPU runtimes plus the remaining data-transfer lift (scratch buffers still map on every command, see the “Data Management Issue” section at `optimization_plan.md:21-36`).
- `src/kernel/kernel_cpu.c:54-114` now keeps traversal limits and node/record bounds in local constants so the hot loops reuse register-resident values, and `src/kernel/kernel_cpu_2.c:184-274` adds `thread_limit(1024)` plus combined start/end leaf scans so each query only walks the tree once before writing `recstart`/`reclength` from the cached `knode` pointers.
- Tests: `make -f Makefile.nvc clean` (clean target only exists in that Makefile) followed by `timeout 300 make -f Makefile.nvc CC=nvc++ CLASS=C run > current_output.txt 2>&1` succeeded; the resulting `current_output.txt:103-122` shows the GPU runtimes for `j` (0.003665 s) and `k` (0.003564 s) plus the normal CPU/GPU verification output.

Outstanding: the per-command scratch buffers are still mapped in/out from host memory, so the data-movement bottleneck documented in the plan remains the next high-impact optimization target.
