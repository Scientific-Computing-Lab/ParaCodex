- Offloaded `kernel_gpu` so all query loops live inside a single `#pragma omp target data` region that maps the dataset once and launches the outer `bid` loop with `#pragma omp target teams loop thread_limit(threadsPerBlock)`; the inner-level scans are now annotated with `#pragma omp loop` so the GPU-level `threadsPerBlock` threads iterate in parallel (`data/src/b+tree-omp/src/kernel/kernel_cpu.c:35-118`).
- Applied the same Strategy A pattern to `kernel_cpu_2`, mapping `knodes`, range endpoints, and all scratch/output buffers once per timed run before driving the traversal + leaf scans with `target teams loop` and nested `loop` pragmas (`data/src/b+tree-omp/src/kernel/kernel_cpu_2.c:92-155`).
- Captured the array inventory, device mapping strategy, and transfer budget in `data_plan.md` to guide implementation decisions, and added `<stdio.h>` to `kernel_cpu_2.c` so the existing `printf` calls are well declared (`data_plan.md:1-64`, `data/src/b+tree-omp/src/kernel/kernel_cpu_2.c:13-15`).
- `diff baseline_output.txt gpu_output.txt` highlights the new GPU timing behavior: `Tree transformation` shifted from 0.058429→0.058693 s, the `MCPU` stage now takes ~1 μs and the kernel stage ~0.14597 s, and the final runtimes moved from 0.004554/0.003738 (CPU/GPU) to 0.005307/0.002024 s (`baseline_output.txt:299-314`, `gpu_output.txt:10-25`).

- Tests: `OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY make -f Makefile.nvc CC=nvc++ CLASS=C` (passes; `nvc++` still reports the pre-existing `main.c` unused-variable warnings plus `max_nthreads` being unused in both kernel sources, and the new `<stdio.h>` include clears the previous implicit `printf` warning).
- Tests: `OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY timeout 300 make -f Makefile.nvc CC=nvc++ CLASS=C run > gpu_output.txt 2>&1` (runs to completion with the new GPU output log above).
- Tests: `diff baseline_output.txt gpu_output.txt` (exit 1 because the GPU-driven kernel now reports longer kernel time but shorter GPU runtime; differences captured in the summary above).

- Next steps: 1) Run the prescribed Class B `nsys` profile once the manifest is ready to confirm that the teams/loop configuration saturates the RTX 4060 Ti, and 2) experiment with tuning `threadsPerBlock` vs. `thread_limit`/team counts if profiling shows low occupancy.
