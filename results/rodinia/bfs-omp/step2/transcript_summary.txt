- Optimized the BFS GPU kernels so each iteration now caches the `Node` metadata in registers, uses `thread_limit(128)` teams hints, and wraps the inner edge scan with `#pragma omp loop` to reduce repeated struct dereferences and guide the compiler toward better parallelism while keeping mask updates local to the kernels (`src/bfs.c:173`).
- Captured the profiling analysis and action plan (current metrics, bottlenecks, proposed actions) in `data/src/bfs-omp/optimization_plan.md:1`, matching the workflow requirements before implementing the kernel changes.
- GPU runtime measured 0.163888s (CPU 0.049860s) in the latest CLASS=C run, and validation still reports zero mismatches, so functional correctness is preserved; the updated `current_output.txt` reflects this steady behavior.

- **Testing:** `make -f Makefile.nvc clean`; `timeout 300 make -f Makefile.nvc CC=nvc++ CLASS=C run > current_output.txt 2>&1`.

- **Next steps:**  
  1. Re-run the CLASS B profiling command with `nsys` (per instructions) to capture the new kernel/memory metrics and determine whether further fusion/caching is justified.  
  2. If profiling still shows the frontier kernel dominating, consider additional tuning (e.g., exploring thread/team limits or partial fusion) guided by the updated profile file at `data/src/bfs-omp/profile.log`.
