**Summary**
- GPU state is now seeded entirely on-device: `BFSGraph` copies only the CSR metadata before calling the new `init_device_state` kernel (see `src/bfs.c:105-170` and `src/bfs.c:286-301`), so the frontier masks, visited flags, and costs are zeroed/seeded on the accelerator rather than copied from redundant host buffers. This matches the Ada Lovelace hardware (`system_info.txt:253-302`), so the builds now target `SM=cc89` under `OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY`.
- `run_gpu_bfs` now aliases the device pointers with `restrict`/`const` locals and caches node metadata per thread to keep the compiler’s view of memory independence tight (see `src/bfs.c:303-343`), while the mask-update kernel still uses the device-only reduction on `loop_stop`.
- The data-movement plan was refreshed to describe the device-only initialization strategy and the reduced transfer volume (see `data/src/bfs-omp/data_plan.md:3-58`), and the original source was backed up at `data/src/bfs-omp/src/bfs.c.pre_opt`.

**Testing**
- `OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY make -f Makefile.nvc CC=nvc++ CLASS=C DEVICE=gpu SM=cc89 run` (baseline pass) → `baseline_output.txt:1-54` shows GPU runtime 0.001679s with the expected validation output.
- `OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY make -f Makefile.nvc CC=nvc++ CLASS=C DEVICE=gpu SM=cc89 run > gpu_output.txt` → `gpu_output.txt:1-7` records the polished run, GPU time 0.000987s, and matching CPU/GPU costs.

Next steps: 1) Run the CLASS B/`nsys` profile when convenient to validate occupancy and kernel overlap once the new initializer is stable.
