Widened the GPU occupancy/aliasing hints so the fused BFS kernel can keep more Ada Lovelace warps busy while letting the compiler pipeline the irregular adjacency walk. 

- **Kernel tuning (bfs.c:159-209)**: Added `restrict` to every `d_graph_*` allocation, swapped both the initializer and traversal directives to `#pragma omp target teams distribute parallel for thread_limit(256)`, and tagged the inner neighbor loop with `#pragma omp loop simd` so the compiler understands that the resident arrays don’t alias and can vectorize the indirect loads even though the graph access is sparse.
- **Plan refresh (optimization_plan.md:3-84)**: Rebuilt the analysis/strategy sections to match the requested template, recorded the baseline metrics from `profile.log`, and appended the final summary with the new 0.048619s runtime, the two applied actions, and the key insights gained from the wider teams and SIMD hints.

- Tests: `make -f Makefile.nvc clean` (reset build) and `timeout 300 make -f Makefile.nvc CC=nvc++ CLASS=C run > current_output.txt 2>&1` (GPU runtime = 0.048619s, GPU/CPU outputs still match).

1. Run the CLASS B `nsys` profiling recipe to capture detailed `cuda_gpu_*` stats for the tuned kernel and confirm whether memory/occupancy improvements show up in the trace.
