- **Outcome**: No edits were made because the existing OpenMP offload kernels already follow the modern `target data` / `target teams loop` structure (see `src/kernel/kernel_cpu.c:75`, `src/kernel/kernel_cpu_2.c:93`), and profiling shows the hotspot is a 0.010349 s CPU/MCPU kernel with only 0.000681 s spent on the GPU; the Nsight Systems export reported no CUDA trace/kernel/memory data to justify manual tuning (profile.log:21, profile.log:30, profile.log:31, profile.log:39, profile.log:40, profile.log:41). 
- **Performance**: CPU runtime is 0.004743 s and GPU runtime 0.000681 s under the current build (profile.log:30, profile.log:31), so occupancy and bandwidth metrics remain unavailable until a future trace captures CUDA kernels because the Ada Lovelace RTX 4060 Ti device (system_info.txt:303) needs richer data to drive tuning decisions.
- **Code style**: Kernels already compute `threadsPerBlock = min(order, 1024)` and rely on OpenMP’s runtime teams/loop scheduling instead of hard-coded launch parameters (`src/kernel/kernel_cpu.c:62`, `src/kernel/kernel_cpu_2.c:79`), which stays aligned with the “modern simple” profiling philosophy.
- **Exploration & next steps**: I re-ran the prescribed `nsys profile` pipeline and attempted to pull reports, but every CUDA/openmp report was skipped because the export contained no GPU traces (profile.log:39‑42). Once you can capture actual kernel events (e.g., retarget `nsys` with additional NVTX markers or try `nv-nsight-cu-cli`), we can revisit explicit team/thread tuning or memory coalescing guided by occupancy/bandwidth numbers.
