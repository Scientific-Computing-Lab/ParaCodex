- Captured the requested hotspot analysis for the point and range traversal kernels in `data/src/bt+tree-omp/analysis.md`, covering iteration counts, operation estimates, memory behavior, parallelization safety, and offload guidance tied directly to the copied source (`src/kernel/kernel_cpu.c` and `src/kernel/kernel_cpu_2.c`) plus the setup routine.
- Mirrored all source files from `golden_labels/src/b+tree_serial` into `data/src/bt+tree-omp/` so future steps can work against the GPU-offload workspace.
- No automated tests were run because the change is analytical; the obvious next step is Step 2 (OpenMP target pragma insertion for the `kernel_cpu` and `kernel_cpu_2` loops) once you’ve reviewed this analysis.
