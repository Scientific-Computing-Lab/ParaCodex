**Changes**
- Collapsed the `j/k` nest and kept the scratch weight buffers resident inside `bpnn_adjust_weights`, using a `#pragma omp target data map(tofrom: …)` block with `target teams loop collapse(2)` so the GPU now launches fewer kernels while processing the entire `ndelta×(nly+1)` domain (`src/backprop.c:441-454`).
- Captured the analysis, baseline metrics, and the final performance summary (including the 2.2× speedup) in `optimization_plan.md`; the “Final (Step 3)” section now lists the optimized runtime (0.153597s) and the completed actions.
- Baseline output remains in `current_output.txt`; the optimized build/run is stored in `optimized_output.txt`, which reports the dominant GPU pass at 0.153597s down from 0.336051s.

**Tests**
- `make -f Makefile.nvc clean`
- `timeout 300 make -f Makefile.nvc CC=nvc++ CLASS=C run > optimized_output.txt 2>&1` (produces the new GPU runtime logs seen above)

**Next Steps**
1. Re-run the CLASS B `nsys` profile command to refresh `profile.log` and verify the collapsed adjust kernel’s percentage of GPU time and any remaining transfer overhead.
