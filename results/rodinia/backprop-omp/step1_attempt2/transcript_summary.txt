- Stabilized the GPU kernels by removing the nowait/depend/taskwait choreography that was triggering `NVC++-F-0000` (see `data/src/backprop-omp/baseline_output.txt`) and relying on synchronous `#pragma omp target teams loop` launches with explicit `target update from`/`map(from)` transfers; this keeps the same scratch buffers while ensuring the host-sum loops execute only once the device copy is fresh (`data/src/backprop-omp/src/backprop.c:303-454`). Saved the pre-change source as `data/src/backprop-omp/src/backprop.c.agentstart` and documented all timed-region arrays, transfers, and the compiler workaround inside `data/src/backprop-omp/data_plan.md`.

- Tests (all with `OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY`): `make -f Makefile.nvc CC=nvc++ CLASS=C` now succeeds and `timeout 300 make -f Makefile.nvc CC=nvc++ CLASS=C run > data/src/backprop-omp/gpu_output.txt 2>&1` produces the reported training output (GPU/CPU runtimes and gate stats). The previous baseline log still captures the ICE so you can compare before/after behavior.

Suggestions:
1. Run the CLASS-B profiling workflow (per your instructions) so you can collect Nsight/Nsys traces on the new offload path.
2. If the toolchain ever fixes the depend/nowait bug, consider revisiting the plan to reintroduce asynchronous launches (the data plan already flags where this would slot in).
