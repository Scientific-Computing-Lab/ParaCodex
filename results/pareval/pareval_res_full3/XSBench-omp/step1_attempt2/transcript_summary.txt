**OpenMP Run**
- No source edits were necessary for this step; a timestamped copy of `Simulation.cpp` was preserved as `data/src/XSBench-omp/Simulation.cpp.pre_migration` before I started.
- Rebuilt with the mandatory OpenMP target flag by running `OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/root/codex_baseline/cuda_omp_pareval_workdir/gate_sdk make -f Makefile.nvc` and then executed `OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=... timeout 300 make -f Makefile.nvc run > gpu_output.txt 2>&1`; the new log in `data/src/XSBench-omp/gpu_output.txt:1-57` documents the OpenMP-target run and checksum of `299541`.
- `diff baseline_output.txt gpu_output.txt` shows the expected migration-induced changes: the baseline log (`data/src/XSBench-omp/baseline_output.txt:105-146`) still reports the CUDA stack with a 0.184 s runtime/543 k lookups/s and kernel time ≈1.3 ms, while the OpenMP-target run (`gpu_output.txt:16-58`) reports 0.370 s runtime, 270 k lookups/s, and kernel_ms≈105.7 ms even though verification remains identical.
- Suggested next steps: (1) profile the OpenMP-target kernel to understand why `kernel_ms` rose to ~105 ms and whether thread/block sizing can be tuned on the RTX 4060 (this will also confirm that the OpenMP offload is saturating the device), and (2) capture the profiling logs (e.g., with `nsys`/`nvprof`) under the same env to ensure the GPU is hit as expected.
