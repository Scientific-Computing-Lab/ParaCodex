- **Work:** Copied all CUDA source files (`Main.cu`, `Simulation.cu`, `GridInit.cu`, `XSutils.cu`, `Materials.cu`, `io.cu`) into `data/src/XSBench-omp/` as `.cpp` versions so they can be compiled by `nvc++` (see, e.g., `data/src/XSBench-omp/Main.cpp:1` and `data/src/XSBench-omp/Simulation.cpp:1`), left the CUDA headers in place, introduced `data/src/XSBench-omp/Makefile.nvc:1` to drive the `nvc++ -cuda` build, and staged the baseline execution log in `data/src/XSBench-omp/baseline_output.txt:1` for future comparison.
- **Analysis:** Captured the required loop/kernels classification, verbatim file mapping, CUDA data-transfer notes, and OMP-migration strategy in `data/src/XSBench-omp/analysis.md:1`, including the nesting structure, full kernel/loop detail sections, summary table, and CUDA-specific/OMP notes that you asked for.
- **Testing:** `make -f Makefile.nvc clean` and `make -f Makefile.nvc run > baseline_output.txt 2>&1` were executed inside `golden_labels/src/XSBench-cuda`; the resulting output is available at `data/src/XSBench-omp/baseline_output.txt:1`.
- **Next steps:** 1. Begin porting `xs_lookup_kernel_baseline` to an OpenMP parallel loop guided by the work breakdown in `analysis.md` and verify against the captured baseline output. 2. Replace the Thrust-based `reduce/count/sort/partition` stages with equivalent host-side algorithms before tackling the optimized kernel variants so that the material partitions remain deterministic during the OpenMP translation.
