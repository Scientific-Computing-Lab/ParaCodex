Set up the nano-XOR analysis environment and documented the CUDA→OMP priorities for the subsequent migration work.

- Copied the original `nanoXOR.cu` into `data/src/nano-XOR-omp/nanoXOR.cpp`, added `include/gate.h`, and created a `Makefile.nvc` that uses `nvc++` to build/run the CUDA source without touching the golden directory; the same kernel logic remains untouched.
- Captured the golden baseline by running `make -f Makefile.nvc run` in `golden_labels/src/nano-XOR-cuda/` and mirrored the resulting `baseline_output.txt` under `data/src/nano-XOR-omp/` for comparison.
- Recorded the loop/kernel classification, launch parameters, CUDA-specific constructs, and migration concerns in `data/src/nano-XOR-omp/analysis.md`, highlighting `cellsXOR` as the dense, CRITICAL kernel and detailing the setup/validation host loops.

Next steps:
1. Translate `cellsXOR`/its neighbor logic into an OpenMP-parallel loop (e.g., `collapse(2)`) while preserving bounds checks and the gate checksum.
2. Build and run the new `data/src/nano-XOR-omp` target (`make -f Makefile.nvc run`) to compare against the captured baseline and validate the OMP version.
