Converted the CUDA stencil driver into an OpenMP target/teams implementation by moving the work into `cellsXOR` (`main.cpp:30`) with a single `target data` region and blockEdge-driven `num_teams/thread_limit`, while preserving the host RNG/validation, and added `nvcpp_wrapper.sh:1` so the Makefile’s `nvc++` invocation can survive the unsupported `-arch` flag by translating it into `-gpu`.

**Testing**
- `timeout 300 env OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY make -f Makefile.nvc run CC=./nvcpp_wrapper.sh` → compiles with the wrapper and prints `Validation passed.` as expected.
- `diff baseline_output.txt current_output.txt | grep -E "Verification|SUCCESSFUL|FAILED"` → exit code 1 because there were no lines containing those keywords in either file.
- `/usr/bin/time -f '%e' env OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY ./microXORh.exe 1024 32` → still validates and runs in 0.02 s on this setup.

**Plan**
- Captured the runtime, kernel hypothesis, and actions in `optimization_plan.md:1`, and noted that `profile.log:1` still only records the compiler/run lines so the usual `cuda_gpu_kern_sum` entries are missing; the plan describes how the new OpenMP region mirrors the CUDA launch while keeping the data strategy intact.

**Next Steps**
- If deeper analysis is required, reprofile with `nsys` (or a similar GPU tracer) over the OpenMP offload to get kernel/memory timing so the plan can be updated with actual GPU metrics.
