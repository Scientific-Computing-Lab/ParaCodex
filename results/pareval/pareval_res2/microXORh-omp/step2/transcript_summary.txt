Cached row pointers, neighbor offsets, and `__restrict__` qualifiers inside `cellsXOR` so each thread reuses precomputed row pointers rather than recomputing `i*N`/`j` for every neighbor access (see `main.cpp:7-27`); the overall OpenMP loop still uses `collapse(2)` but now writes through a row-specific `rowOut` pointer for leaner pointer math.

Captured the measured runtime/profile metrics, bottleneck hypotheses, and both the action plan and final performance summary in `optimization_plan.md:1-51`, including the lack of measurable speedup and the remaining D↔H transfer/validation limit.

Tests:
- `make -f Makefile.nvc clean; env OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY timeout 300 make -f Makefile.nvc run` (produced `Validation passed.`)
- `env OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY time ./microXORh.exe 1024 32` (measured 0.31s wall time after the changes)

Next step: consider moving validation on to the device or streaming subsets back so that the 4.2 MB D→H copy can be avoided and the host-side randomization/validation path ceases to dominate the 0.3 s runtime.
