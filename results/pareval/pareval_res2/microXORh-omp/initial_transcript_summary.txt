Captured the CUDA→OpenMP analysis for microXORh, kept the CUDA driver in place for the data workspace, and preserved the golden baseline for future comparison.

- Copied `golden_labels/src/microXORh-cuda/main.cu` to `data/src/microXORh-omp/main.cpp` (C++17) so the existing `Makefile.nvc` still sees the expected source without editing the logic.
- Added `data/src/microXORh-omp/analysis.md`, which records the file mapping, nesting structure, per-kernel/loop priority, CUDA-specific constructs, a summary table, and an OMP migration strategy (including the RNG caution for the init loop).
- Saved the golden run log under `data/src/microXORh-omp/baseline_output.txt` after invoking the provided `Makefile.nvc`, giving a reference point for any future OpenMP execution.

Tests:
- `make -f golden_labels/src/microXORh-cuda/Makefile.nvc clean`
- `make -f golden_labels/src/microXORh-cuda/Makefile.nvc run > baseline_output.txt 2>&1`

Next steps:
1. Translate `cellsXOR` into nested host loops with `#pragma omp parallel for collapse(2)` so each `(i,j)` cell is processed with the same neighbor logic.
2. Replace CUDA allocations/transfers with host buffers (e.g., `std::vector<int>`), drop the CUDA runtime include, and handle RNG initialization carefully if you parallelize the setup loop.
