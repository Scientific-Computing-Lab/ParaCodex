- `nanoXOR.cpp:12` now marks inputs/outputs as `__restrict__`, caches the grid stride, and replaces the flattened `target teams loop` with a `target teams distribute parallel for collapse(2)` so each thread reuses a precomputed `idx` and mirrors the CUDA 2D layout while avoiding div/mod in the hot path.
- `optimization_plan.md:1` now records the measured runtime/kernel/memory-transfer metrics, the chosen hypotheses/action list, and (from `optimization_plan.md:20`) the final summary that notes the unchanged 0.610 s runtime, the applied optimizations, CUDA→OMP recovery status, micro-opts, and key insights.

Testing:
- `make -f Makefile.nvc clean`
- `timeout 300 env OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY make -f Makefile.nvc run` (regenerated `profile.log`, matched `baseline_output.txt`, and left `current_output.txt` showing the validation pass/`Minfo` lines)

Next steps:
1. Profile or parallelize the host-side RNG/validation to attack the ~0.61 s host wait that dwarfs the 49 µs kernel.
2. Investigate overlapping the OpenMP data region with computation or moving validation logic onto the device if further runtime gains are needed.
