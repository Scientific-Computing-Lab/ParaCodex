Converted `nanoXOR.cpp` into an OpenMP offload path and captured the migration plan so the kernel, memory work, and launch geometry now mirror the CUDA flow without any CUDA APIs.

- **Implementation**: `cellsXOR` now flattens the grid into a `#pragma omp target teams loop` that derives `(i,j)` from a linear index, sizes teams/threads from `blockEdge`, and runs inside a `#pragma omp target data map(...)` region so the buffers stay mapped on the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 (Ada Lovelace) hardware reported in `system_info.txt`, while the host-side validation and checksum remain unchanged (see `nanoXOR.cpp:7`).
- **Data plan**: Added `data_plan.md` to document every CUDA allocation/transfer, justify Strategy A, and spell out the OpenMP replacement for the kernel and data movement (see `data_plan.md:1`).
- **Testing**: `make -f Makefile.nvc clean`; `make -f Makefile.nvc`; `timeout 300 env OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY make -f Makefile.nvc run > gpu_output.txt 2>&1`.
- **Diff**: `diff baseline_output.txt gpu_output.txt` shows two differences—the compiler/invocation lines now report `nvc++` instead of `nvcc`, and the `GATE:SUM` value is `1767250b51083c33` because the RNG output is not locked to the baseline’s previous random sequence.

Next steps: 1) Either seed the RNG deterministically or capture a new baseline `baseline_output.txt` from this OpenMP build so future diffs can pass, and 2) consider running the provided `nsys` profile commands after this migration to compare GPU activity between CUDA and OpenMP paths.
