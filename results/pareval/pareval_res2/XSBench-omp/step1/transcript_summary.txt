**Summary**
- Rebuilt the event-based driver so `run_event_based_simulation` now delegates to an OpenMP offload baseline loop; the new implementation allocates every `SimulationData` buffer with `omp_target_alloc`, offloads `xs_lookup_kernel_baseline` through `#pragma omp target teams loop is_device_ptr(...)`, copies the verification buffer home, and releases device state (see `data/src/XSBench-omp/Simulation.c:1-223`). This also removed the CUDA/Thrust-only optimization kernels, leaving just the baseline path plus helper utilities.
- Added `move_simulation_data_to_device`/`release_device_memory` helpers and a `#pragma omp declare target` block for the RNG/lookup utilities so the kernel body can call them on-device while maintaining their original logic (`data/src/XSBench-omp/Simulation.c:224-420`).
- Documented the host→device strategy, kernel inventory, and transfer budget in `data/src/XSBench-omp/data_plan.md:1-58`, and preserved the original CUDA source as `data/src/XSBench-omp/Simulation.c.bak` before the rewrite.

**Testing**
- `make -f Makefile.nvc clean` (pass)
- `make -f Makefile.nvc` (pass; `nvc++` emitted its usual loop/vectorization diagnostics but no errors)
