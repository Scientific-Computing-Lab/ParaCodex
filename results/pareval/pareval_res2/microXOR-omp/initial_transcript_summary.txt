Captured the CUDA golden baseline run with `make -f Makefile.nvc run` and preserved the log next to the future OpenMP work so downstream comparisons can be done (`data/src/microXOR-omp/baseline_output.txt#L1`).

Documented the CUDA kernel/loop hierarchy, priority/type classification, arrays/transfers, and OMP migration notes in `data/src/microXOR-omp/analysis.md#L1`, including the required file conversion mapping, summary table, CUDA-specific detail checklist, and a practical OMP strategy section.

Next steps for the migration:
1. Port `cellsXOR` to an OpenMP `parallel for collapse(2)` region that mirrors the `(i,j)` grid and neighbor-count logic while keeping boundary checks identical.
2. Parallelize the `input` fill by giving each thread-private RNG state or pre-generating the random bitstream before the parallel loop to avoid races in `std::mt19937`.
3. Once the OpenMP driver and kernel are in place, rebuild under `data/src/microXOR-omp` and run the harness (e.g., `make -f Makefile.nvc run`/`gate_harness`) to compare against the captured CUDA baseline.
