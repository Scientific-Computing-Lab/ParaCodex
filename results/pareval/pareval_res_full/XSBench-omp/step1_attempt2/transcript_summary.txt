**Offload Fixes**
- Each `#pragma omp target` kernel now caches the pointers it needs into locals (e.g., `p_energy_samples`, `num_nucs`, `nuclide_grid`, etc.) before the `is_device_ptr` clause, so the clauses no longer refer to struct members directly. This matches the OpenMP clause limitations and keeps the kernels from dereferencing host addresses unexpectedly (`data/src/XSBench-omp/Simulation.cpp:283-520` covers the revised `sampling_kernel` plus the baseline and optimization variants).
- The same locals are passed through to `calculate_macro_xs`/`calculate_micro_xs` so the device code still sees the intended data; verification writes now use the local `verification` pointer instead of the struct member.

**Tests**
- `OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY make -f Makefile.nvc clean`
- `OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY make -f Makefile.nvc NVCC="nvc++ -cuda -std=c++14 -gpu=cc89 -O3"`
- `timeout 300 bash -lc 'OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY make -f Makefile.nvc NVCC="nvc++ -cuda -std=c++14 -gpu=cc89 -O3" run > gpu_output.txt 2>&1'`
  (the GPU run logs live in `data/src/XSBench-omp/gpu_output.txt`; the checksum still reads `299541 (Valid)` and the run reports host-to-device and kernel timings as shown in that file).

**Diff**
- `diff baseline_output.txt gpu_output.txt` now just shows the expected switch from the CUDA log (nvcc compile warnings, “CUDA Device” section, far higher lookups/s) to the OpenMP log (OpenMP target device messages and the new timing line), so the runtime divergence is understood and the verification checksum stays unchanged.

Next step: keep using the NVCC override (`-gpu=cc89`) when building/running until the build system is updated to drop `-arch=sm_89`.
