**Summary**
- Added a dedicated XSBench-OMP workspace by copying the CUDA sources into `.cpp` variants (e.g., `data/src/XSBench-omp/Simulation.cpp:1` remains content-identical but uses the new suffix) alongside the shared headers so the code can build under `nvc++`.
- Created `data/src/XSBench-omp/Makefile.nvc:1` which drives compilation with `nvc++ -cuda`, includes `gate_sdk`, and exposes `clean/run` targets for the copied sources, and preserved the golden baseline log at `data/src/XSBench-omp/baseline_output.txt:1`.
- Authored `data/src/XSBench-omp/analysis.md:1`, documenting every kernel/loop nesting structure, priority/type classification, CUDA-specific constructs, and OMP migration flags for Simulation.cpp and friends.

**Testing**
- `make -f Makefile.nvc run` (golden CUDA tree) → baseline output captured in `data/src/XSBench-omp/baseline_output.txt:1` (warnings about unused `fread` results only); the new OMP workspace hasn’t been rebuilt yet.

**Next Steps**
1. Use the newly created `analysis.md` to guide translating the kernels, especially by targeting the Type-A dense loops and replacing Thrust-based sorts/reductions with CPU equivalents.
2. Once a CUDA-capable environment is available, run `make -f data/src/XSBench-omp/Makefile.nvc` (and `run`) to verify the converted sources build and execute with the same flags.
