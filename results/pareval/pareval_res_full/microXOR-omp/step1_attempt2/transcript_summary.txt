**Status**
- The workspace already contains the translated OpenMP variant (`data/src/microXOR-omp/main.cpp` and `microXOR.cpp`), so no additional source edits were necessary.
- Attempting to build with `env OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY make -f Makefile.nvc` right after a clean failed because `nvc++` could not find its RC/tools (`acclnk`, `nvdd`, `pgnvd`) and rejects the CUDA-oriented switches (`-cuda`, `-arch=sm_89`). The NVIDIA HPC SDK install referenced in `system_info.txt` (RTX 4060 / driver 581.15) isn’t exposed to the compiler from this directory, so the run couldn’t proceed.

**Tests**
- `env OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY make -f Makefile.nvc` *(fails: `nvc++` needs a full NVIDIA HPC toolchain/RC file and reports missing tools plus unsupported `-cuda/-arch` switches, so no object/executable was produced.)*

**Next Steps**
1. Provide or point the build to a complete NVIDIA HPC SDK installation (including `acclnk`, `nvdd`, `pgnvd`, and the matching RC files) so `nvc++` can honor GPU offload flags from `Makefile.nvc`.
2. Once the toolchain is functional, run `timeout 300 env OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY make -f Makefile.nvc run > gpu_output.txt 2>&1` and diff `baseline_output.txt` vs. `gpu_output.txt` to verify correctness.
