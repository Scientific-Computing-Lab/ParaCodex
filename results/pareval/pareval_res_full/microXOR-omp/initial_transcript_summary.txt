**Summary**
- Converted the CUDA driver and kernel into `data/src/microXOR-omp/main.cpp:1-89` and `data/src/microXOR-omp/microXOR.cpp:1-32`, swapped the include to `data/src/microXOR-omp/include/microXOR.h:1-9`, and kept the original logic so the renamed sources stay compilable.  
- Added an `nvc++`-based build/run harness in `data/src/microXOR-omp/Makefile.nvc` plus the baseline execution log from the CUDA version (`data/src/microXOR-omp/baseline_output.txt:1-5`).  
- Documented the kernel/loop structure, CUDA-specific constructs, and migration guidance in `data/src/microXOR-omp/analysis.md`.

**Testing**
- `make -f data/src/microXOR-omp/Makefile.nvc` (nvc++ builds the CUDA sources; emits the expected advisory that CUDA C++ compilation under `nvc++` is unsupported but succeeds).  
- `make -f golden_labels/src/microXOR-cuda/Makefile.nvc run` (produced the baseline output copied to `data/src/microXOR-omp/baseline_output.txt`).

**Next steps**
1. Use the analysis to rewrite `cellsXOR` as OpenMP-parallel nested loops and replace the CUDA launch/memory calls with host allocations.  
2. Re-run the new OMP driver against the recorded baseline input to verify the result matches `Validation passed.`
