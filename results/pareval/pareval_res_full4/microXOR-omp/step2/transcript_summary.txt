**Summary**
- Documented the measured metrics, hypotheses, and final before/after narrative (0.367s → 0.269s) in `optimization_plan.md`, with the plan details at `optimization_plan.md:3` and the final summary beginning at `optimization_plan.md:19`.
- Reworked `cellsXOR` (see `microXOR.cpp:10`) to keep `pitch`, `rowStart`, `idx`, and const-local `src/dst` handy so each loop iteration reuses offsets instead of recomputing `i * N + j`, which yields the 1.36× wall-clock gain.
- The profile log still shows the kernel at ~35.9µs and the transfers at ~2.27ms (`profile.log:181` and `profile.log:187`), so only micro arithmetic work changed.
- Confirmed the offload target is the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Laptop GPU reported in `system_info.txt:110`, so the Ada/cc89 settings stay appropriate.

**Testing**
- `make -f Makefile.nvc clean`
- `timeout 300 env OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY make -f Makefile.nvc run > current_output.txt 2>&1`
- `diff baseline_output.txt current_output.txt | grep -E "Verification|SUCCESSFUL|FAILED"` (exit 1 because only the checksum line differentiates the outputs)
- `time env OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY ./microXOR.exe 1024 32` (real 0.269s)

**Next Steps**
1. Regenerate the `nsys` profile with the new binary to confirm the trimmed index math is reflected inside the kernel report.
2. If additional speed is required, look at accelerating the host-side setup/validation loops so the remaining ~0.27s is not dominated by CPU work.
