- Copied the CUDA sources into the OMP data workspace so the future translation starts from the same code; the files now live at `data/src/microXOR-omp/main.cpp:1`, `data/src/microXOR-omp/microXOR.cpp:1`, and the shared header at `data/src/microXOR-omp/include/microXOR.cuh:1`, preserving the kernels as-is with new suffixes.
- Added an `nvc++` build script that mirrors the CUDA harness and points to `gate_sdk`, producing `microXOR.exe` with the same runtime arguments (`data/src/microXOR-omp/Makefile.nvc:1`).
- Recorded the CUDA baseline build/run via `Makefile.nvc` and captured the full stdout/stderr in `data/src/microXOR-omp/baseline_output.txt:1` for regression tracking.
- Authored the requested analysis document (`data/src/microXOR-omp/analysis.md:1`) that maps every source conversion, outlines the kernel/loop nesting, classifies `cellsXOR` plus host loops, and documents CUDA-specific behaviors and OMP migration considerations.

Next steps:
1. Translate `cellsXOR` and its supporting host loops into an OpenMP equivalent (removing the CUDA malloc/memcpy) and use the new `Makefile.nvc` to build that variant.
2. Run the translated binary, compare its output against `baseline_output.txt`, and update the analysis if any new dependencies (e.g., reductions or synchronization) surface.
