**Summary**
- Copied the CUDA source into the OpenMP workspace as `data/src/nano-XOR-omp/nanoXOR.cpp#L1` (main and kernel remain unchanged) and added an `nvc++`-based makefile at `data/src/nano-XOR-omp/Makefile.nvc#L1` so the translated workspace has a build target that mirrors the requested compiler.
- Ran `make -f Makefile.nvc clean` and `make -f Makefile.nvc run` inside the CUDA workspace, capturing the compile/run trace plus the `Validation passed`/`GATE:SUM` confirmation in `data/src/nano-XOR-omp/baseline_output.txt#L1`.
- Documented the kernel/loop classification, CUDA data flow, and OMP-migration concerns (file mapping, nested structure, priority, dependencies, RNG/validation caveats, etc.) in `data/src/nano-XOR-omp/analysis.md#L1`.

Next steps:
1. Begin translating `cellsXOR` into nested OpenMP loops with `collapse(2)` and drop the CUDA memory copy path while keeping the boundary logic intact.
2. Rework the input and validation loops to be parallel-safe (thread-local RNG seeds and a shared failure flag/reset of `cleanup`/logging) before running the OpenMP version through the same harness.
