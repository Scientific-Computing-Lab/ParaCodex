Prepared the data tree by copying the CUDA driver, adding a nvc++ build, capturing the golden baseline run, and drafting the loop/kernel analysis needed for the OpenMP migration.

- **Build artifacts:** `data/src/microXORh-omp/main.cpp` now mirrors `golden_labels/src/microXORh-cuda/main.cu`, and `data/src/microXORh-omp/Makefile.nvc` invokes `nvc++`/`-cuda` so the copied CUDA source compiles in the new workspace; the runtime arguments mimic the golden harness.
- **Baseline capture:** re-ran `make -f Makefile.nvc clean` and `make -f Makefile.nvc run > baseline_output.txt` in `golden_labels/src/microXORh-cuda` and copied the resulting `baseline_output.txt` into `data/src/microXORh-omp/baseline_output.txt` so the OpenMP effort has a reference.
- **Analysis:** `data/src/microXORh-omp/analysis.md` details the `cellsXOR` kernel (Type G, CRITICAL stencil), the host initialization loop, and the validation nest, including launch configs, priority, dependencies, CUDA-specific notes (thread indexing, memory transfers), and suggested OMP migration strategies (parallel 2D loop, removal of device copies, handling RNG and validation output).

Next steps:
1. Built on the analysis to implement an OpenMP version of `cellsXOR` (e.g., `collapse(2)` parallel loops, private `count`, remove `cudaMalloc/cudaMemcpy`).
2. Validate the translated driver by running `make -f data/src/microXORh-omp/Makefile.nvc run` and comparing behavior/output to the captured baseline.
