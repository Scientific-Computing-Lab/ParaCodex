Copied the CUDA workspace into the OMP staging area, captured the baseline run, and documented the CUDA kernels’ loop hierarchy for migration planning.

- Captured the reference execution by running `make -f Makefile.nvc clean` and `make -f Makefile.nvc run > baseline_output.txt 2>&1` inside `golden_labels/src/XSBench-cuda/`, then copied the resulting `baseline_output.txt` into `data/src/XSBench-omp/baseline_output.txt:1` for later comparison.
- Mirrored every CUDA source from `golden_labels/src/XSBench-cuda/` to `data/src/XSBench-omp/`, renaming each `.cu` to `.cpp` (e.g., `data/src/XSBench-omp/Simulation.cpp:1`, `data/src/XSBench-omp/Main.cpp:1`, `data/src/XSBench-omp/GridInit.cpp:1`, `data/src/XSBench-omp/XSutils.cpp:1`, `data/src/XSBench-omp/io.cpp:1`, `data/src/XSBench-omp/Materials.cpp:1`) while keeping headers (`XSbench_header.cuh`, `XSbench_shared_header.h`) identical.
- Added a new `Makefile.nvc` that compiles the renamed sources with `nvc++` and mirrors the original build flow (`data/src/XSBench-omp/Makefile.nvc:1`); note that this Makefile has not been executed yet in the new directory.
- Produced `data/src/XSBench-omp/analysis.md:1` capturing the file-conversion mapping, host/kernel nesting, device-loop classification (Types A–C1), CUDA-specific constructs, and OMP migration flags for the baseline and optimization kernels.

Suggestions:
1. Run `make -f Makefile.nvc` inside `data/src/XSBench-omp/` to verify that the renamed sources compile under `nvc++` before proceeding with any OpenMP translations.
2. Use the analysis in `data/src/XSBench-omp/analysis.md` to start rewriting the dominant `xs_lookup_kernel_baseline` path into an OpenMP-parallelized loop, paying special attention to the irregular `num_nucs[mat]` inner loop and the material partitioning stages.
