**Nano-XOR Update**
- Added `data/src/nano-XOR-omp/nanoXOR.cpp` (a verbatim copy of the CUDA source) and a new `Makefile.nvc` (`data/src/nano-XOR-omp/Makefile.nvc:1-18`) that builds it with `nvc++ -std=c++17 -cuda -gpu=sm_89 -I../../../gate_sdk` and links against `libcudart`.
- Captured the golden build/run output and saved it as the reference baseline at `data/src/nano-XOR-omp/baseline_output.txt:1`, matching the required `make -f Makefile.nvc run` invocation.
- Verified the new environment by running `make -f Makefile.nvc run` inside `data/src/nano-XOR-omp/`, which succeeded (emitting only the “CUDA C++ compilation is unsupported in nvc++; nvcc is the recommended CUDA compiler” warning) and produced validation output; the executable still passes the gate checksum.
- Documented the kernel/loop priorities, CUDA constructs, and OMP migration notes in `data/src/nano-XOR-omp/analysis.md:1-78`, including the stencil kernel classification, host loop roles, and suggested OpenMP mapping.

Next steps:
1. Use the analysis notes (especially the “cellsXOR” Type G breakdown) to draft the OpenMP equivalent kernel/loops, focusing on a `collapse(2)` parallel regional worklist.
2. Replace the CUDA allocations/transfers with native host arrays and parallelize the initialization/validation loops safely (thread-local RNG and a stop flag for early exits), then rebuild/run to verify correctness.
