Ported the CUDA microXOR driver/kernel into an OpenMP-target build: the host now keeps just the host buffers, a target-data region maps them to the RTX 4060 (per `system_info.txt`), and `cellsXOR` runs as a `#pragma omp target teams loop collapse(2)` so that `OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY` drives the GPU without any CUDA API calls.

- `main.cpp:3-84`: removed CUDA memory management, kept the validation logic, and wrapped the `cellsXOR` call in `#pragma omp target data map(to: input[0:N*N]) map(from: output[0:N*N])`, with a simplified `cleanup` that only deletes host buffers.
- `microXOR.cpp:1-17` & `include/microXOR.cuh:1-10`: converted the legacy `__global__` kernel into a plain function that launches with `#pragma omp target teams loop collapse(2)` and updated the header to declare the host-visible prototype without CUDA includes.
- `data_plan.md:1-75`: documented the CUDA→OpenMP strategy, devices/arrays/transfers, and the decision to use a target-data region to match the former memory workflow.

**Testing**
- `make -f Makefile.nvc clean`
- `make -f Makefile.nvc`
- `OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY make -f Makefile.nvc run` (log captured in `gpu_output.txt`: `./microXOR.exe 1024 16` followed by `Validation passed.`)
- `diff baseline_output.txt gpu_output.txt` (exit 1 because the baseline file records the prior CUDA compile log plus a `1024 32` run, whereas the current execution only logs the OpenMP run with `blockEdge=16`)

Next steps:
1. Align the current run arguments (or update `baseline_output.txt`) so the diff compares identical invocations and removes the constant build/log mismatch.
2. Once the CLI target is stable, consider following the profiling step from the instructions (`nsys profile ...`) to characterize the OpenMP offload kernel.
