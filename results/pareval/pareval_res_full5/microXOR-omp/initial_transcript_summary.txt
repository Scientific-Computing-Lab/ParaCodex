**Changes**
- Mirrored the CUDA sources into `data/src/microXOR-omp/` as `.cpp` files (`main.cpp`, `microXOR.cpp`) with their `include/microXOR.cuh` header and captured the golden baseline run in `data/src/microXOR-omp/baseline_output.txt` (the file was produced by `golden_labels/src/microXOR-cuda/Makefile.nvc` as requested).
- Added `data/src/microXOR-omp/Makefile.nvc` so the data workdir can be rebuilt with `nvc++ -cuda -gpu=sm_89`, matching the existing invocation pattern while pointing at the shared `gate_sdk` include/lib.
- Authored `data/src/microXOR-omp/analysis.md` to log the source-to-target mapping, kernel/loop nesting summary, detailed Type G/stencil analysis for `cellsXOR`, host loop classifications, CUDA-specific data notes, and OMP-migration guidance.

**Testing**
- `make -f Makefile.nvc run` (in `golden_labels/src/microXOR-cuda`) – captured the reference `GATE:SUM` validation output in `baseline_output.txt`.
- `make -f Makefile.nvc run` (in `data/src/microXOR-omp`) – builds with `nvc++` (warning: “CUDA C++ compilation is unsupported in nvc++; nvcc is the recommended CUDA compiler”) but still completes and prints `GATE:SUM …` plus `Validation passed.`.

Next steps:
1. Start translating `cellsXOR` into an OpenMP-parallel loop using the Type G stencil guidance from `analysis.md` and reuse the host buffers directly instead of copying to CUDA memory.
2. After the OpenMP version is ready, regenerate its output and compare against `data/src/microXOR-omp/baseline_output.txt` to verify numerical equivalence before tuning.
