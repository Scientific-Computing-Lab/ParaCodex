I updated the stencil kernel so each teams/loop offload now caches its row offsets and uses `__restrict__`ed pointers, giving a cleaner, lower-index arithmetic path on the RTX 4060 while keeping the existing single target data region, and I documented the metrics/actions/summary in `optimization_plan.md`.

**Changes**
- `data/src/microXOR-omp/microXOR.cpp:8-29` now stores `stride`, reuses cached `current_row/prev_row/next_row` pointers, adds an inline comment, and keeps the `target teams loop` intact so the offload no longer recomputes `i * N` for every neighbor read while still writing via the precomputed `row_start`.
- `data/src/microXOR-omp/include/microXOR.cuh:1-10` updates the `cellsXOR` declaration to carry the same `__restrict__` hints so the compiler can treat the two buffers as non-aliased on host and device sides.
- `data/src/microXOR-omp/optimization_plan.md` records the measured runtime (0.02s after the tweaks), notes that the nsys log didn’t emit any concrete kernel/transfer numbers, captures the RTX 4060 (compute 8.9) hardware context, lists the micro-optimizations/insights, and summarizes the before/after comparisons for this CUDA→OMP port.

**Testing**
- `make -f Makefile.nvc clean`
- `timeout 300 env OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY make -f Makefile.nvc run > current_output.txt 2>&1`
- `env OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY time ./microXOR.exe 1024 32` (pre and post changes show ≈0.03s → ≈0.02s; validation still prints `GATE:SUM` and “Validation passed.”)
- `diff baseline_output.txt current_output.txt | grep -E "Verification|SUCCESSFUL|FAILED"` (exit 1 because neither output contains those keywords; validation text differs only in the random checksum, so the run is still successful)

Next steps:  
1. Run `nsys profile` (making sure the generated `.sqlite`/`.nsys-rep` files stay in the workspace) to capture actual kernel and transfer timings so you can determine whether you’re within 5% of expected optimal runtime.  
2. If further tuning is needed, experiment with larger N/blockEdge pairs or additional micro-opts (e.g., prefetching the current row into a temporary register) and rerun the plan/test workflow above.
