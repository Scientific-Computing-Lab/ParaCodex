**Results**
- Copied the CUDA driver from `golden_labels/src/microXORh-cuda/main.cu` into `data/src/microXORh-omp/main.cpp:1` (renamed to `.cpp` only) so the content stays identical for later conversions.
- Added an `nvc++`-based build (`data/src/microXORh-omp/Makefile.nvc:1`) that mirrors the original flags, producing `microXORh.exe` and exposing a `run` target matching the golden harness.
- Captured the CUDA baseline by running `make -f Makefile.nvc run` in the golden directory and copied the results to `data/src/microXORh-omp/baseline_output.txt:1`.
- Authored `data/src/microXORh-omp/analysis.md:1` documenting the kernel, host loops, data movement, CUDA semantics, and OMP migration considerations for every critical component.

Next steps:
1. Translate `cellsXOR`’s per-cell stencil into nested OpenMP `parallel for` loops while preserving the boundary guards and ensuring each thread computes exactly one cell.
2. Replace CUDA allocation/copy idioms with host memory and, if needed, add OpenMP-friendly validation or initialization loops driven by the analysis notes.
