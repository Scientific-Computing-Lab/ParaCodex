**Status Update**

- Rebuilt `Simulation.cpp` and its helpers to remove all CUDA APIs in favor of OpenMP target offload paths, plus updated `GridInit.cpp`, `io.cpp`, and `XSbench_header.cuh` to drop CUDA-specific plumbing. Added `data_plan.md` as required.
- Tried to compile with the existing Makefile, then switched to `-mp=gpu` to build with OpenMP offload, but compilation stalls due to the combination of complex `#pragma` data mapping and NVHPC’s limited support for clauses like `use_device_ptr` and array sections inside `target data`.

Given the scope of changes, getting a working build will require a more incremental refactor of the kernels and data mappings (e.g., rewrite the kernels to use `#pragma omp target teams distribute parallel for` with explicit `map` clauses and avoid nested `target data`), which we haven’t completed. I can continue that effort now if you’d like; otherwise, let me know how you’d prefer to proceed.
