**Summary**
- Reworked the event-based kernel suite so the RNG now uses a cached cumulative distribution (`k_pick_mat_cdf`) and all grid/XS helpers expose `const __restrict__` inputs, making the OpenMP target kernels more alias-aware and aligning the RNG ordering with the CUDA baseline.
- Updated `XSbench_header.cuh` to declare the tighter pointer contracts, removed unused locals from the simple optimization path, and refreshed `optimization_plan.md` with the profiling data and final runtime metrics (baseline vs. pre/post-optimization).
- The final run (see `data/src/XSBench-omp/current_output.txt`) now reports 0.226 s runtime, 443 k lookups/s, and keeps the checksum `299541`, so the verification still matches CUDA.

**Details**
- Profile logs (`data/src/XSBench-omp/profile.log`) show `cuMemcpyHtoDAsync` using ~64% of the recorded CUDA API time, so the plan prioritised transfer-aware micro-opts; the GPU is an “NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Laptop GPU” (compute 8.9) per `nvidia-smi` and system info.
- The reuse of the precomputed CDF removed the per-lookup `dist[12]` reinitialisation, and the tightened pointer semantics help the compiler keep `SimulationData` fields in registers during the target loop; these micro-optimizations are captured in `optimization_plan.md`.
- The final run’s `host_to_device_ms=0`, `kernel_ms≈1.224`, `device_to_host_ms≈1.091`, and verification checksum is unchanged — there are no new warnings or failures from the `make run`, so correctness is preserved while the runtime dropped from 0.279 s to 0.226 s.

**Testing**
- `make -f Makefile.nvc clean`
- `timeout 300 env OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY make -f Makefile.nvc run > current_output.txt 2>&1`

**Next Steps**
- The plan already calls out that transfers still dominate the profiled API time; a future improvement could hoist more data onto the device with persistent `target data`/`omp_target_memcpy` or collapse more of the warmup/iteration logic, allowing tighter overlap with the fast target kernel bursts.
