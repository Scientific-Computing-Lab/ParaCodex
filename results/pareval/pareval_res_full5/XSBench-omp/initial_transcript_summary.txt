Copied the CUDA XSBench sources into `data/src/XSBench-omp`, created an `nvc++` build script, preserved the golden baseline run log, and wrote the requested loop-classification analysis.

- Added `data/src/XSBench-omp/Makefile.nvc` plus renamed `Main.cu/io.cu/Simulation.cu/GridInit.cu/XSutils.cu/Materials.cu` → `*.cpp`, keeping their content untouched and pointing the new build at `nvc++` with the existing `gate_sdk` includes.
- Captured `golden_labels/src/XSBench-cuda`’s baseline run (`make -f Makefile.nvc run > baseline_output.txt`) and copied the output to `data/src/XSBench-omp/baseline_output.txt` so the reference log lives next to the derived workspace.
- Authored `data/src/XSBench-omp/analysis.md` with mapping info, nesting/priority tables, kernel-by-kernel details (with line references), CUDA-specific annotations, and numbered OpenMP-migration notes per the provided template—we now have the documentation needed for stage two.

Next steps: (1) when `nvc++` is available, run `make -f Makefile.nvc` in `data/src/XSBench-omp` to confirm the copied sources build. (2) Use the analysis to guide the actual CUDA→OpenMP translation: convert the baseline and optimization kernels into OpenMP parallel loops, replace `thrust` utilities with CPU equivalents, and port the `cudaMalloc`/`cudaMemcpy` data management to host memory.
