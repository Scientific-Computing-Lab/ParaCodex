- **Analysis** I captured the CUDA→OMP workload picture in `data/src/microXOR-omp/analysis.md:1`; it lists the conversion mappings, nesting structure, kernel/loop details, summary table, CUDA-specific observations, and suggested migration strategy so you can jump straight to the insights for `cellsXOR` and the surrounding host loops (`analysis.md:10`).  
- **Baseline** Ran `make -f Makefile.nvc clean` and `make -f Makefile.nvc run > baseline_output.txt` inside `golden_labels/src/microXOR-cuda`, and the captured CUDA output is now mirrored in `data/src/microXOR-omp/baseline_output.txt:1`.  
- **Next Steps (suggested):** 1) Use the analysis outline to drive the OpenMP rewrite for `cellsXOR` (dense 2D work, no atomics or syncthreads, so a `parallel for collapse(2)` is a natural fit). 2) Once the OpenMP sources are in place, rebuild/run `data/src/microXOR-omp` via its Makefile to confirm performance/validation parity with the CUDA baseline.
