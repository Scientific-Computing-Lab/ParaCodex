**Summary**
- Captured the CUDA baseline by running `make -f Makefile.nvc clean` and `make -f Makefile.nvc run > baseline_output.txt 2>&1` in `golden_labels/src/XSBench-cuda`; the resulting log now lives at `data/src/XSBench-omp/baseline_output.txt` for the OMP workspace.
- Copied `Simulation.cu` into the OMP workspace as `data/src/XSBench-omp/Simulation.c`, updating its include to `XSbench_header.h` so it resolves the headers that already exist alongside the other converted sources.
- Produced `data/src/XSBench-omp/analysis.md`, which maps the CUDA-to-OMP file, enumerates host loops and kernels (with line references), classifies priority/type per the decision tree, and flags migration issues such as RNG state, Irregular `num_nucs[mat]` loops, and thrust-based counts/sorts.

**Testing**
- `make -f Makefile.nvc clean` (golden `XSBench-cuda`)
- `make -f Makefile.nvc run > baseline_output.txt 2>&1` (golden `XSBench-cuda`, output copied to the OMP workspace)

Next steps: have the OMP translation team review `analysis.md` (and the converted `Simulation.c`) to plan actual parallel-for replacements and to replace the `thrust` reductions/sorts with host-friendly equivalents.
