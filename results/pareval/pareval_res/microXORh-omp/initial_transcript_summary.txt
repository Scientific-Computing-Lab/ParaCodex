Copied the CUDA driver from `golden_labels/src/microXORh-cuda/main.cu` into `data/src/microXORh-omp/main.cpp` (content untouched) so the target Makefile can build against the converted filename.  
Saved the reference run output by invoking `make -f Makefile.nvc run > baseline_output.txt 2>&1` in `golden_labels/src/microXORh-cuda` and copying the captured `baseline_output.txt` into `data/src/microXORh-omp/baseline_output.txt`.  
Documented the loop/kernel priorities, CUDA constructs, and OMP-migration considerations in `data/src/microXORh-omp/analysis.md` per the requested format (includes mapping, nesting, summary table, and strategy notes).  

Next steps:  
1. Use the analysis notes to rewrite `cellsXOR` as an OpenMP-parallelized host loop (replacing the CUDA kernel launch, copies, and allocations with CPU data movement).  
2. Confirm the new OMP version compiles via `data/src/microXORh-omp/Makefile.nvc` and compare its output against `baseline_output.txt` before proceeding with further translation or optimization.
