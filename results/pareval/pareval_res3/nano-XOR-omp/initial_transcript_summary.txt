- Copied `golden_labels/src/nano-XOR-cuda/nanoXOR.cu` straight into `data/src/nano-XOR-omp/nanoXOR.cpp`, keeping content identical while matching the data makefile’s expected `.cpp` source.
- Rebuilt and ran the original CUDA target (`make -f Makefile.nvc clean` + `make -f Makefile.nvc run > baseline_output.txt 2>&1`) and placed the resulting log in `data/src/nano-XOR-omp/baseline_output.txt` for reference.
- Produced `data/src/nano-XOR-omp/analysis.md`, covering the kernel/loop nesting, priority/type classification, CUDA-specific data-transfer details, and a migration strategy sketch tailored to the simple `cellsXOR` kernel plus its host loops.

Next steps:
1. Use the analysis to rewrite `cellsXOR`’s domain loop as an OpenMP parallel region and replace the CUDA allocations/copies with host equivalents.
2. Retain the validation and initialization loops (with optional `omp parallel for` annotations) or keep them serial if early-exit semantics are desired.
