Ensured `Simulation.c` compiles and links by explicitly declaring the helper kernels, fixing all `omp_target_memcpy` signatures, and adding a dispatching `run_event_based_simulation` entry so `Main.c` can continue to switch on `kernel_id`.

- Declared each kernel helper before it’s used, made their definitions `static`, and moved the baseline entry into the new prototype area so `nvc++` no longer emits implicit-declaration warnings (`data/src/XSBench-omp/Simulation.c:21-76`).
- Updated every `omp_target_memcpy` to use the full `(dst, src, size, dst_offset, src_offset, dst_device, src_device)` signature for verification, sample, and data transfers; the helpers (`copy_verification_from_device`, `copy_samples_*`, `move_simulation_data_to_device`) now work with the OpenMP API rather than the trimmed CUDA-like form (`data/src/XSBench-omp/Simulation.c:903-1226`).
- Added `run_event_based_simulation` near the bottom of the file so the CLI-managed `kernel_id` path can hit any of the optimized kernels without linker errors (`data/src/XSBench-omp/Simulation.c:830-917`).

Tests:
- `OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY make -f Makefile.nvc`
- `timeout 300 env OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY make -f Makefile.nvc run > data/src/XSBench-omp/gpu_output.txt 2>&1`
- `diff baseline_output.txt gpu_output.txt` (baseline is the CUDA log; the result shows expected differences in build log, reported programming model, runtime/lookups/s, and profiling line because the OpenMP offload run is a different build and timing environment)

Next steps: rerun with other `-k` kernel IDs or profiling knobs if you want to validate the other optimization paths, and keep `gpu_output.txt` handy if you need to compare future OpenMP runs.
