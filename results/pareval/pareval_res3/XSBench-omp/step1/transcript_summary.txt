Converted the CUDA-driven simulation in `Simulation.c` into an OpenMP-targeted flow and captured the required data/strategy details for the larger translation task.

- Reworked the baseline driver/primary kernel into host functions that call `#pragma omp target teams loop` with the device pointers created by the new allocator; timing, verification copying, and RNG helpers now use the host-side helpers so the workload stays consistent (`data/src/XSBench-omp/Simulation.c:22-329`).
- Replaced every optimization path with logic that allocates offload buffers, runs the sampling/lookup loops via the new target kernels, and performs necessary host-side sorting/partitioning before copying the samples back for execution (`data/src/XSBench-omp/Simulation.c:330-894`).
- Added device-memory helpers, scratch-copy/reduction utilities, and host sample sorting/partition routines so the OpenMP data management mirrors the CUDA flow without any NVIDIA APIs (`data/src/XSBench-omp/Simulation.c:900-1264`).
- Documented the CUDA→OpenMP memory strategy, kernel inventory, and chosen Strategy B in `data/src/XSBench-omp/data_plan.md:1-93`.
- Saved the pre-change snapshot as `data/src/XSBench-omp/Simulation.c.bak:1`.

Testing: not run (build/test suite not invoked).

Next steps:
1. Rebuild with `make -f Makefile.nvc` (using `OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY`) and run the workload so you can compare `gpu_output.txt` against the provided baseline file.
