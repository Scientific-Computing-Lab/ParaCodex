**Updates**
- Reduced alias ambiguity in the hot lookup kernels by giving every buffer a `const restrict` copy and caching per-material rows inside `calculate_macro_xs`, so the GPU loops now expose clearer independence (`Simulation.c:59-116`, `Simulation.c:189-230`, `Simulation.c:396-448`). The verification checksum stayed the same, but the run logged 0.280s runtime with ~259ms of host→device traffic (current_output.txt shows the same verification and timing numbers as before).
- Captured the baseline data, bottlenecks, micro-optimizations, final summary, checklist, and profiling commands in `optimization_plan.md` so the team can track the transfer-heavy runtime and the aliasing work that just touched the hot kernels (`optimization_plan.md:1-59`).

**Testing**
- `make -f Makefile.nvc clean` (clean rebuild)
- `timeout 300 env OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY make -f Makefile.nvc run > current_output.txt 2>&1` (baseline run; host→device still dominates, but verification passes)
- `diff baseline_output.txt current_output.txt | grep -E "Verification|SUCCESSFUL|FAILED"` (no output → runs match baseline checks)

Next steps:
1. Investigate whether the large host→device copy of `SimulationData` can be hoisted/overlapped or kept resident across iterations to attack the ~90% transfer cost that the micro-opts cannot touch.
2. If data residency changes are not viable under the current strategy, consider offloading only the compute-critical portions (e.g., `nuclide_grid`) while leaving smaller lookup buffers on the host to shrink the transfer footprint.
