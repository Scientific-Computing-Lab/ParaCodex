**Summary**
- Copied `golden_labels/src/XSBench-cuda/Simulation.cu` to `data/src/XSBench-omp/Simulation.c` and updated the include to `XSbench_header.h` so the C build in `data/src/XSBench-omp/` can compile without CUDA-specific headers (`data/src/XSBench-omp/Simulation.c:1`).
- Collected the reference GPU baseline by running `make -f Makefile.nvc clean` and `make -f Makefile.nvc run > baseline_output.txt` in the CUDA workspace, then placed the captured log under `data/src/XSBench-omp/baseline_output.txt`.
- Added `data/src/XSBench-omp/analysis.md` documenting file mappings, host/kernels nesting, per-kernel priority/type details (with line references to `Simulation.cu`), a summary table, CUDA-specific observations, and OMP migration guidance tailored to the XSBench kernels.

**Testing**
- `make -f Makefile.nvc clean` (golden CUDA reference)
- `make -f Makefile.nvc run > baseline_output.txt 2>&1` (golden CUDA reference)

**Next Steps**
1. Use `data/src/XSBench-omp/analysis.md` to drive the first-pass OpenMP port of each dense lookup kernel and its host orchestration loops.
2. Replace the Thrust-based sorts/reductions with CPU equivalents (e.g., parallelized `std::sort`/`std::partition` plus OpenMP reductions) before wiring the translated kernels into the existing OMP makefile.
