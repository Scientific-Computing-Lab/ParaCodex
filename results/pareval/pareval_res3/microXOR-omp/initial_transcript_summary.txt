Documented the CUDA kernel/loop behavior and captured a fresh golden baseline so the upcoming OpenMP migration has a solid reference point.

- Added `data/src/microXOR-omp/analysis.md:1` to record the `.cu → .cpp/.hpp` mappings, the kernel/loop nesting, per-loop Type/Priority details, the summary table, CUDA-specific observations, and detailed OMP migration notes for `cellsXOR` and the surrounding host loops.
- Captured the golden build/run log with `make -f Makefile.nvc clean` plus `make -f Makefile.nvc run > baseline_output.txt 2>&1`, then copied it to `data/src/microXOR-omp/baseline_output.txt`; see `baseline_output.txt:1` for the nvcc compile log, `:4` for the `./microXOR.exe 1024 32` invocation, and `:6` for the `Validation passed.` confirmation.

Next steps:
1. Use the new analysis doc to drive the OpenMP reimplementation of `cellsXOR` (e.g., collapse the 2D loop over `i,j`), keeping the same data layout and host-side validation logic.
2. Once the OpenMP binary in `data/src/microXOR-omp` is rebuilt, rerun `make -f Makefile.nvc run` there and compare its output against the saved baseline file to close the correctness loop.
