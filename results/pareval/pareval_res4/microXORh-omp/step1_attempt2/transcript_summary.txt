**Status**
- Could not find any `main.cu` in `data/src/microXORh-omp` (only `main.cpp` exists, which already holds the OpenMP offload version of `cellsXOR` with the mapped data region shown at `data/src/microXORh-omp/main.cpp:1`).
- A data-management plan already lives at `data/src/microXORh-omp/data_plan.md:1`; it describes the single stencil kernel, Strategy A, and the H↔D transfers, so no further plan creation was possible without the missing CUDA source.

Next steps:
1. Please provide the CUDA `main.cu` you want translated (or confirm we should adjust `main.cpp` instead), then I can follow the outlined workflow and data-plan instructions.
