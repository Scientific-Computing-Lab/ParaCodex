- `cellsXOR` now takes the CLI’s `blockEdge`, clamps the inferred `thread_limit`/`num_teams` to sane values, and flattens the 2D domain into a single `target teams loop` so the V100-style launch helpers in `libacc` always see a positive grid (main.cpp#L17, main.cpp#L21, main.cpp#L25, main.cpp#L28, main.cpp#L30); the call site in `main` now forwards `blockEdge` (main.cpp#L74-L78) and we include `<climits>` so the teams computation can safely compare against `INT_MAX` (main.cpp#L3).
- Tests: `make -f Makefile.nvc clean` and `make -f Makefile.nvc` succeed, but the mandated `timeout 300 env OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY make -f Makefile.nvc run > data/src/microXORh-omp/gpu_output.txt 2>&1` still aborts before the stencil, triggering `SIGABRT` inside `platform_cuda/hxCuda.c:2764` (as seen in `gdb -batch -ex run -ex bt --args … ./microXORh.exe 32 4`); the truncated output sits in `data/src/microXORh-omp/gpu_output.txt` along with the `Aborted (core dumped)` notice, so no baseline diff could be produced.
- Next steps:
  1. Investigate the `libacc`/CUDA runtime abort (e.g., enable vendor debug logs or check plugin discovery) so the OpenMP kernel can actually launch under `OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY`.
  2. Once offloading runs, rerun the harness, capture `gpu_output.txt`, and diff against `baseline_output.txt` to confirm correctness.
