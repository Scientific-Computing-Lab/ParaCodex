- Captured the CUDA loop/kernels picture in `data/src/microXOR-omp/analysis.md:1` (file mapping, nesting diagram, per-loop details, priority/type table, CUDA-specific notes, and OMP migration flags) so the next phase has the runtime structure, data flow, and conversion concerns clearly documented.
- Ran `make -f Makefile.nvc clean` and `make -f Makefile.nvc run` in `golden_labels/src/microXOR-cuda` and copied the resulting log into `data/src/microXOR-omp/baseline_output.txt:1` so baseline performance/validation output stays alongside the analysis.

Next steps:
1. Use this documentation to plan the OpenMP rewrite of `cellsXOR` (parallel 2D loop with collapsed `#pragma omp parallel for`) and the host loops, preserving the RNG and validation semantics.
2. After translating, rebuild the OMP binary against `data/src/microXOR-omp/Makefile.nvc` and compare its output to the captured baseline to ensure correctness before further optimization.
