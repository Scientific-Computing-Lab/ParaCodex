**Summary**
- Copied `nanoXOR.cu` to `data/src/nano-XOR-omp/nanoXOR.cpp#L1` so the data build has the same CUDA logic available under the C++ source name referenced by `Makefile.nvc`.
- Saved the golden `make -f Makefile.nvc run` output (it prints `Validation passed.` plus the GATE checksum) into `data/src/nano-XOR-omp/baseline_output.txt#L1`.
- Captured the kernel/loop nesting, CUDA dependencies, work priorities, and OMP migration flags in `data/src/nano-XOR-omp/analysis.md#L1` for use during the translation phase.

**Testing**
- `make -f Makefile.nvc run` (golden_labels/src/nano-XOR-cuda) — success, produced the baseline log now copied to the data tree.

Next steps:
1. Use the analysis as a blueprint for the OpenMP migration: replace `cellsXOR` with a collapsed `#pragma omp parallel for`, make RNG initialization/validation thread-friendly, and preserve the final checksum-based verification.
