**OpenMP Baseline**

- Replaced the CUDA-green runtime in `Simulation.c` with an OpenMP offload pipeline: added `MatEnergy` helpers for sorting/partitioning (lines 3‑95), wrapped RNG and XS helpers in `#pragma omp declare target` (lines 97‑335), and converted every `__global__` kernel to `#pragma omp target teams loop` versions that invoke `evaluate_lookup` (lines 338‑500).  
- Rebuilt the driver path so the public `run_event_based_simulation` now drives the new baseline kernel and the six optimization paths inside `#pragma omp target data` regions, with explicit `target update` calls whenever host-side sorting/partitioning touches the sample buffers (lines 502‑792). Each optimization now allocates/cleans the sample buffers, stages them for sorting, and copies verification results back to the host for reduction and profiling.

**Supporting documentation**

- Added `data_plan.md` (lines 1‑88) that documents the CUDA allocation/transfer inventory, the chosen Strategy A data movement approach, and the OpenMP mapping/kernels plan, fulfilling the mandatory planning step.
- Saved `Simulation.c.bak` as the pre-conversion snapshot.

**Tests**

- `make -f Makefile.nvc clean` (cleared previous objects).  
- `make -f Makefile.nvc` (both compile steps succeeded; the usual `-Minfo` diagnostics were emitted by `nvc++`, but no errors).

**Next steps**

1. Run `OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY timeout 300 make -f Makefile.nvc run > gpu_output.txt 2>&1` and compare `gpu_output.txt` with `baseline_output.txt` to validate correctness.
