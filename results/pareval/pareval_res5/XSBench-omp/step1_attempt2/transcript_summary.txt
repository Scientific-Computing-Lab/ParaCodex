**Need Clarification**

- I can’t proceed with the CUDA→OpenMP migration yet because there is no `Simulation.cu` under `/root/codex_baseline/cuda_omp_pareval_workdir/data/src/XSBench-omp/`—the only source there is `Simulation.c`, which already looks like an OpenMP version, and there isn’t a CUDA `.cu` file to convert in that directory.
- The only `Simulation.cu` in the workspace resides in `golden_labels/src/XSBench-cuda/`, which appears to be the CUDA reference, but your instructions explicitly forbid editing files outside the working directory and limit edits to `Simulation.cu`, so I need to know which file you actually want me to touch.

Could you confirm which `Simulation.cu` (or other source) should be migrated, and whether it should live under `data/src/XSBench-omp/`?
