- `Simulation.c:87-143` now demarcates the baseline lookup data as `const __restrict__` so the OpenMP teams loop can assume the grid tables are read-only, non-aliased, and cache-friendly without changing any of the core traversal logic.
- `Simulation.c:145-315` now hoists the fixed `material_probs` table into device scope and has `pick_mat` walk a single running sum instead of rebuilding nested sums per lookup, keeping the emitted material sequence deterministic while trimming the RNG helper’s quadratic work.
- `optimization_plan.md:19-53` documents the analysis, actions, and new measurements (0.202 s runtime with host→device ≈195 ms, kernel ≈2 ms, checksum 299541) along with key insights about the remaining transfer bottleneck; `current_output.txt:45-54` records those runtime/verification numbers from the final test run.

Tests:
- `make -f Makefile.nvc clean`
- `timeout 300 env OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY make -f Makefile.nvc run > current_output.txt 2>&1` (final run reports 0.202 s overall, 495 k lookups/s, 299541 checksum; the earlier `diff baseline_output.txt current_output.txt | grep -E "Verification|SUCCESSFUL|FAILED"` produced no matches, so the verification status remains unchanged).

Suggestions:
1. Explore whether persistent device allocations or `omp target enter data`/`is_device_ptr` patterns can be layered onto this code once allowed, since the fixed 241 MB host→device copy (~195 ms) still dwarfs the kernel time.
2. If more speedup is required, rerun the profiler (nsys) after further micro-opts to see whether any remaining work (e.g., inside `calculate_macro_xs`) can be cached or refactored without triggering extra transfers.
