I’m sorry, but I wasn’t able to finish the CUDA→OpenMP migration in time. I ran into repeated “Illegal Address” failures when running the OpenMP offload baseline kernel; the kernel executes fine on the CPU, and the problem seems tied to the device-data mapping/handoff. I’d need more time to restructure the data-mapping strategy (perhaps by handling, copying, and updating the mapped arrays differently or avoiding manual `target enter/exit` usage) to get a stable GPU run. Let me know if you’d like me to continue debugging that kernel-mapping flow or rework the memory handling strategy so the offloaded version can actually execute.
