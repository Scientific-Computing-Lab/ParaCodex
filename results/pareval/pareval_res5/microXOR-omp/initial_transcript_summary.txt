- Documented the CUDA→OpenMP migration plan, loop/kernel structure, CUDA-specific notes, and the required file mapping in `data/src/microXOR-omp/analysis.md:1`; the file includes the kernel/loop detail blocks, summary table, and strategy notes for translating `cellsXOR` plus the host loops.
- Captured the golden baseline run log (including the `Validation passed.` checksum entry) at `data/src/microXOR-omp/baseline_output.txt:1` after executing `make -f Makefile.nvc clean` and `make -f Makefile.nvc run`.
- No source files were modified beyond the new analysis document and the baseline log, keeping the CUDA sources untouched per instructions.

Next steps:
1. Implement the OpenMP version of `microXOR.cu` (target `microXOR.cpp`) so `main.cpp` can drive the OMP kernel described in the analysis.
2. Replace the CUDA allocations/copies with host arrays/parallel loops, then rerun the harness and compare against the baseline log to confirm functional parity.
