Added an OpenMP-offloaded replacement for `cellsXOR` and captured the mandated data-management reasoning so the driver can now run without any CUDA API calls.

- `data/src/microXOR-omp/microXOR.cpp:1` now contains a `#pragma omp target teams loop collapse(2)` offload of the 2D stencil, maps the host buffers to the device for the duration of the kernel, and mirrors the original neighbor-count logic so the output behavior matches the CUDA version.
- `data/src/microXOR-omp/data_plan.md:1` documents the Strategy A plan (single kernel, simple map clauses) along with the CUDA allocation/copy profile and the OpenMP equivalents to guide the migration and future reviewers.

**Tests**
- `make -f Makefile.nvc clean`
- `make -f Makefile.nvc`
- `timeout 300 env OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY make -f Makefile.nvc run > gpu_output.txt 2>&1` (produced `./microXOR.exe 1024 32` followed by `Validation passed.`)
- `diff baseline_output.txt gpu_output.txt` (exit 1; baseline log captures the legacy `nvcc` compile commands and a gate checksum, while the new run only emits the executable invocation and validation sentence)
