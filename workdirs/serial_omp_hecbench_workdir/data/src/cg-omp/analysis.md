# CG Serial Analysis

Unable to proceed with loop analysis because the expected source directory `golden_labels/src/cg-serial` and its `cg.c` file are not present in the repository. I attempted to copy the files as required, but the source path does not exist, so no loops could be inspected or documented.

Please provide the `cg-serial` source tree (including `cg.c`) under `golden_labels/src/` so I can rerun the loop discovery commands and fill out the analysis in full.

## Summary Table
| Function | Type | Priority | Strategy |
|----------|------|----------|----------|
| _none_ (source missing) | N/A | N/A | Pending provision of `golden_labels/src/cg-serial/cg.c` |
